# 7.3 WiFi: 802.11 Wireless LANs

- WiFi (IEEE 802.11) provides wireless connectivity in local areas.
- **Components:** Access points (AP), stations (clients).
- **MAC:** CSMA/CA for medium access.
- **Security:** WPA2/WPA3, encryption.

---

## WiFi Architecture
- **Infrastructure mode:** AP connects clients to wired network.
- **Ad hoc mode:** Devices communicate directly.

---

## MAC Protocol
- **CSMA/CA:** Listen before transmit, avoid collisions with backoff.
- **ACKs:** Confirm successful reception.

---

## Security
- **WPA2/WPA3:** Strong encryption, authentication.
