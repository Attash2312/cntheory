# 7.7 Managing Mobility in Cellular Networks

- Cellular networks manage mobility using handoff and location management.
- **Handoff:** Switch connection as device moves between cells.
- **Location management:** Track device location for call/data delivery.

---

## Handoff Types
- **Hard handoff:** Abrupt switch, possible brief disconnect.
- **Soft handoff:** Overlap, smoother transition (CDMA).

---

## Location Management
- **Paging:** Network locates device for incoming call/data.
- **Registration:** Device updates location with network.
