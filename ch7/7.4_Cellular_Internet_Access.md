- **LTE jargon: User Equipment (UE)**

### Base Station (eNode-B)
- **At "edge" of carrier's network**
- **Manages wireless radio resources, mobile devices in its coverage area ("cell")**
- **Coordinates device authentication with other elements**
- **Similar to WiFi AP but:**
  - **Active role in user mobility**
  - **Coordinates with nearby base stations to optimize radio use**
- **LTE jargon: eNode-B**

---

## Radio Access Network: 4G Radio

### Connection Process
- **Connects device (UE) to a base station (eNode-B)**
- **Multiple devices connected to each base station**
- **Many different possible frequencies bands, multiple channels in each band**
- **Popular bands: 600, 700, 850, 1500, 1700, 1900, 2100, 2600, 3500 MHz**

- **Lie on data path from mobile to/from Internet**
- **P-GW: gateway to mobile cellular network**
- **Looks like any other internet gateway router**
- **Provides NAT services**
- **Other routers: extensive use of tunneling**

- **Mobile device management:**
  - **Device handover between cells**
  - **Tracking/paging device location**

---

## LTE Data Plane Protocol Stack: Packet Core

### Tunneling Process

- **S-GW re-tunnels datagrams to P-GW**
- **Supporting mobility: only tunneling endpoints change when mobile user moves**

### Protocol Stack
- **GTP-U, UDP, IP, link, Physical layers**

---

## LTE Data Plane: Associating with a BS

### Association Process
1. **BS broadcasts primary synch signal every 5 ms on all frequencies**
   - **BSs from multiple carriers may be broadcasting synch signals**
2. **Mobile finds a primary synch signal, then locates 2nd synch signal on this freq.**
   - **Mobile then finds info broadcast by BS: channel bandwidth, configurations; BS's cellular carrier info**
   - **Mobile may get info from multiple base stations, multiple cellular networks**
3. **Mobile selects which BS to associate with (e.g., preference for home carrier)**
4. **More steps still needed to authenticate, establish state, set up data plane**

---

## LTE Mobiles: Sleep Modes

### Power Conservation
- **As in WiFi, Bluetooth: LTE mobile may put radio to "sleep" to conserve battery:**
  - **Light sleep: after 100's msec of inactivity**
  - **Wake up periodically (100's msec) to check for downstream transmissions**
  - **Deep sleep: after 5-10 secs of inactivity**
  - **Mobile may change cells while deep sleeping – need to re-establish association**

- **5G on an evolutionary path (like the Internet)**

### Agility and Customization
- **Agility: cloud technologies (SDN) mean new features can be introduced rapidly, deployed continuously**
