# 7.10 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: CDMA Sharing
**Question:**
How does CDMA allow multiple users to share the same channel?
**Solution:**
- Each user has a unique code; signals are separated at the receiver using codes.

## Example 2: WiFi vs. Bluetooth
**Question:**
List two differences between WiFi and Bluetooth.
**Solution:**
- WiFi: Longer range, higher speed, LAN use.
- Bluetooth: Short range, low power, PAN use.

## Example 3: Handoff Scenario
**Question:**
Describe the difference between hard and soft handoff in cellular networks.
**Solution:**
- Hard: Abrupt switch, possible disconnect.
- Soft: Overlap, smoother transition (CDMA).

## Example 4: Mobile IP Tunneling
**Question:**
How does tunneling work in Mobile IP?
**Solution:**
- Home agent forwards packets to care-of address via tunnel.

## Example 5: Security in Wireless
**Question:**
List two security risks in wireless networks and how to mitigate them.
**Solution:**
- Eavesdropping: Use encryption (WPA2/WPA3).
- Spoofing: Use authentication protocols.

---

## Example 6: WiFi Security
**Question:**
Why is WPA2 preferred over WEP in WiFi?
**Solution:**
- WPA2 uses stronger encryption and authentication.

---

## Example 7: Wireless Impairments
**Question:**
List two impairments affecting wireless links.
**Solution:**
- Path loss, interference, multipath fading, shadowing.

---

## Example 8: TCP over Wireless
**Question:**
How does wireless loss affect TCP performance?
**Solution:**
- TCP may reduce rate unnecessarily, thinking loss is congestion.

---

## Example 9: Paging in Cellular Networks
**Question:**
What is paging and why is it important in cellular networks?
**Solution:**
- Paging is the process of locating a mobile device for call/data delivery; ensures the network can reach the device.

## Example 10: WiFi MAC Protocol
**Question:**
Explain how CSMA/CA works in WiFi and why it is needed.
**Solution:**
- Devices listen before transmitting, use random backoff to avoid collisions; needed because wireless cannot detect collisions directly.
