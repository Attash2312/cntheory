## Chapter 7 Complete Overview

### Introduction
- **Wireless and mobile networks context**
- **More wireless phone subscribers than fixed (10-to-1 in 2019)**
- **More mobile-broadband-connected devices than fixed-broadband-connected devices (5-1 in 2019)**
- **4G/5G cellular networks embracing Internet protocol stack, including SDN**

### Two Important Challenges
1. **Wireless: communication over wireless link**
2. **Mobility: handling the mobile user who changes point of attachment to network**

## Wireless Links and Network Characteristics

### Key Impairments
- **Fading (attenuation): Free space path loss ~ (fd)²**
- **Multipath propagation: radio signal reflects off objects**
- **Coherence time (Tc): inversely proportional to frequency and receiver velocity**
- **Noise and interference: SNR vs BER tradeoff**
- **Hidden terminal problem: A, C cannot hear each other interfering at B**

### CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
- **Unique "code" assigned to each user**
- **All users share same frequency, but each user has own "chipping" sequence**
- **Encoding: inner product: (original data) × (chipping sequence)**
- **Decoding: summed inner-product: (encoded data) × (chipping sequence)**

## Cellular Networks: 4G and 5G

### 4G LTE Architecture
- **Mobile device (UE): smartphone, tablet, laptop, IoT with 4G LTE radio**
- **Base station (eNode-B): manages wireless radio resources**
- **Home Subscriber Service (HSS): stores mobile device info**
- **Serving Gateway (S-GW), PDN Gateway (P-GW): data path**
- **Mobility Management Entity (MME): device authentication, handover**

### Radio Access Network
- **OFDM: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing**
- **Physical Resource Block (PRB): 7×12=84 resource elements**
- **Transmission Time Interval (TTI): 1 ms**
- **Popular bands: 600, 700, 850, 1500, 1700, 1900, 2100, 2600, 3500 MHz**

### 5G Evolution
- **Goals: 10x increase in peak bitrate, 10x decrease in latency, 100x increase in traffic capacity**
- **5G NR: FR1 (450 MHz–6 GHz) and FR2 (24 GHz–52 GHz)**
- **Millimeter wave frequencies, MIMO, pico-cells**
- **Microservice-like architecture, SDN-like control plane**

## Mobility Management: Principles

### Spectrum of Mobility
- **No mobility: device stays in same network**
- **High mobility: device moves between networks, but powers down while moving**
- **Complex mobility: device moves among multiple provider networks, while maintaining ongoing connections**

### Mobility Approaches
- **Network-based: routers advertise mobile locations (not scalable)**
- **End-system: indirect routing vs direct routing**
- **Indirect routing: communication goes through home network**
- **Direct routing: correspondent gets foreign address directly**

### Home Network Concept
- **Home network: (paid) service plan with cellular provider**
- **Visited network: any network other than home network**
- **Registration: visited mobility manager registers mobile's location with home HSS**

---

## Mobility Management: Practice

### 4G Mobility Tasks
1. **Base station association: mobile provides IMSI**
2. **Control-plane configuration: MME, home HSS establish state**
3. **Data-plane configuration: MME configures forwarding tunnels**
4. **Mobile handover: device changes point of attachment**

### Handover Process
- **Source BS selects target BS, sends Handover Request**
- **Target BS pre-allocates radio time slots, responds with HR ACK**
- **Source BS informs mobile of new BS**
- **Target BS informs MME, MME instructs S-GW to change tunnel endpoint**

### GTP Tunneling
- **S-GW to BS tunnel: change endpoint IP address when mobile moves**
- **S-GW to home P-GW tunnel: implementation of indirect routing**
- **GTP (GPRS tunneling protocol): mobile datagram encapsulated in UDP**

---

## Mobile IP

### Historical Context
- **Standardized ~20 years ago [RFC 5944]**
- **Did not see wide deployment/use**
- **WiFi and 2G/3G were "good enough" at the time**

### Architecture
- **Mobile IP home agent: combined roles of 4G HSS and home P-GW**
- **Mobile IP foreign agent: combined roles of 4G MME and S-GW**
- **Protocols for agent discovery, registration via ICMP extensions**

### Comparison with 4G
- **Mobile IP: Single protocol for all mobility**
- **4G: Separate protocols for different aspects**
- **Mobile IP: More general-purpose**
- **4G: Optimized for cellular networks**

## Mobility: Impact on Higher-Layer Protocols

### Logical vs Performance Impact
- **Logically: minimal impact, best effort service model unchanged**
- **Performance-wise: significant impact**
  - **Packet loss/delay due to bit-errors and handover loss**
  - **TCP interprets loss as congestion, decreases congestion window unnecessarily**
  - **Delay impairments for real-time traffic**
  - **Bandwidth a scarce resource for wireless links**

### Solutions
- **Link-layer retransmissions**
- **Split TCP connections**
- **Adaptive bitrate streaming**
- **Mobile-optimized applications**
