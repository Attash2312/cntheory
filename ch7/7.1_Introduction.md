## Case Studies & Real-World Strategies

### 1. WiFi Deployment and Optimization
- **Google, Amazon, Apple:** Use WiFi 6/6E in offices, warehouses, and retail for high device density, seamless roaming, and IoT support.
- **Universities, Airports, Stadiums:** Deploy dense WiFi networks with multiple access points, load balancing, and fast handoff for thousands of users. Use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise for secure authentication.
- **Facebook:** Provides free public WiFi in developing regions to expand Internet access.

### 2. Cellular Network Evolution and 5G
- **Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile:** Roll out 5G using a mix of macro towers, small cells, and mmWave for high speed and low latency. Use carrier aggregation and MIMO for capacity.
- **Reliance Jio (India):** Rapidly deployed 4G LTE nationwide, using VoLTE for voice and data convergence.
- **Apple:** Designs iPhones to support seamless handoff between WiFi and cellular (WiFi Assist, VoWiFi).

### 3. Mobility Management and Handoff
- **Google Fi:** Uses multi-carrier SIMs and automatic handoff between T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular for best coverage.
- **Apple iOS:** Uses Multipath TCP (MPTCP) for seamless transition between WiFi and cellular in FaceTime and Siri.

### 4. Security and Authentication
- **Mobile Carriers:** Use SIM-based authentication and EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA for secure network access.
- **Enterprises:** Use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise, 802.1X, and RADIUS for secure WiFi authentication.

### 5. Wireless in IoT and Smart Cities
- **Amazon Sidewalk:** Uses Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa for wide-area IoT connectivity in smart home devices.
- **Smart Cities:** Deploy public WiFi, cellular IoT (NB-IoT, LTE-M), and sensor networks for traffic, utilities, and public safety.
