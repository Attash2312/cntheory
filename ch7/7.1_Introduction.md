## Elements of a Wireless Network

### Wired Network Infrastructure
- **Backbone network providing connectivity**
- **Internet access and core services**

### Wireless Hosts
- **Laptop, smartphone, IoT devices**
- **Run applications**
- **May be stationary (non-mobile) or mobile**
- **Wireless does not always mean mobility!**

### Base Station
- **Typically connected to wired network**
- **Relay - responsible for sending packets between wired network and wireless host(s) in its "area"**
- **Examples: cell towers, 802.11 access points**

### Wireless Link
- **Typically used to connect mobile(s) to base station, also used as backbone link**
- **Multiple access protocol coordinates link access**
- **Various transmission rates and distances, frequency bands**

## Infrastructure Mode vs Ad Hoc Mode

### Infrastructure Mode
- **Base station connects mobiles into wired network**
- **Handoff: mobile changes base station providing connection into wired network**

### Ad Hoc Mode
- **No base stations**
- **Nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage**
- **Nodes organize themselves into a network: route among themselves**

---

## Wireless Network Taxonomy

### Single Hop
- **Infrastructure (e.g., APs):**
  - **Host connects to base station (WiFi, cellular) which connects to larger Internet**
- **No infrastructure:**
  - **No base station, no connection to larger Internet (Bluetooth, ad hoc nets)**

### Multiple Hops
- **Infrastructure:**
  - **Host may have to relay through several wireless nodes to connect to larger Internet: mesh net**
- **No infrastructure:**
  - **No base station, no connection to larger Internet. May have to relay to reach other a given wireless node MANET, VANET**

## Real-World Analogy
- Wireless networks are like walkie-talkies: devices communicate over the air, moving freely within coverage areas.
