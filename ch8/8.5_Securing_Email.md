# 8.5 Securing E-Mail

- Secure email ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of messages.
- Uses encryption, digital signatures, and certificates.

---

## 8.5.1 Secure E-Mail
- **Encrypts message content and attachments.**
- **Uses digital signatures for sender authentication.**

---

## 8.5.2 PGP
- **Pretty Good Privacy:** Combines symmetric and public key cryptography.
- **Encrypts message with symmetric key, then encrypts key with recipient's public key.**
- **Diagram:**

  A[Message] -- Encrypt (Symmetric Key) --> B[Encrypted Msg]
  C[Symmetric Key] -- Encrypt (Public Key) --> D[Encrypted Key]
  B & D -- Send --> E[Recipient]

## More Email Security Protocols
- **S/MIME:** Uses X.509 certificates for email encryption and signing.
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Prevents sender address forgery.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Adds digital signature to emails.
- **DMARC:** Builds on SPF and DKIM, provides policy and reporting for email authentication.
