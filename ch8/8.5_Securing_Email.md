# 8.5 Securing E-Mail

- Secure email ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of messages.
- Uses encryption, digital signatures, and certificates.

## Secure E-Mail: Confidentiality

### Alice's Process
- **Alice wants to send confidential e-mail, m, to Bob**
- **Alice generates random symmetric private key, KS**
- **Alice encrypts message with KS (for efficiency)**
- **Alice also encrypts KS with Bob's public key**
- **Alice sends both KS(m) and KB+(KS) to Bob**

### Bob's Process
- **Bob uses his private key to decrypt and recover KS**
- **Bob uses KS to decrypt KS(m) to recover m**

### Key Components
- **KS( ): Symmetric encryption**
- **KB+( ): Bob's public key encryption**
- **KS(m): Encrypted message**
- **KB+(KS): Encrypted symmetric key**

---

## Secure E-Mail: Integrity, Authentication

### Alice's Process
- **Alice wants to send m to Bob, with message integrity, authentication**
- **Alice digitally signs hash of her message with her private key, providing integrity and authentication**
- **Alice sends both message (in the clear) and digital signature**

### Components
- **H( ): Hash function**
- **KA-( ): Alice's private key**
- **H(m): Message digest**
- **KA-(H(m)): Digital signature**

---

## Secure E-Mail: Complete Security

### Alice's Process
- **Alice sends m to Bob, with confidentiality, message integrity, authentication**
- **Alice uses three keys: her private key, Bob's public key, new symmetric key**

### Bob's Complementary Actions
1. **Uses his private key to decrypt symmetric key**
2. **Uses symmetric key to decrypt message**
3. **Uses Alice's public key to verify signature**
4. **Compares hash of received message with decrypted signature**

## 8.5.1 Secure E-Mail
- **Encrypts message content and attachments.**
- **Uses digital signatures for sender authentication.**

---

## 8.5.2 PGP
- **Pretty Good Privacy:** Combines symmetric and public key cryptography.
- **Encrypts message with symmetric key, then encrypts key with recipient's public key.**
- **Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Message] -- Encrypt (Symmetric Key) --> B[Encrypted Msg]
  C[Symmetric Key] -- Encrypt (Public Key) --> D[Encrypted Key]
  B & D -- Send --> E[Recipient]
  F[Message] -- Hash --> G[Digest]
  G -- Sign (Private Key) --> H[Signature]
  H -- Send with Message --> E
```

## Email Security Protocols Comparison

### PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
- **Web of trust model**
- **User-generated keys**
- **Widely used for personal email**

### S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
- **X.509 certificate-based**
- **Enterprise standard**
- **Integrated with email clients**

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- **Prevents sender address forgery**
- **DNS-based authentication**
- **Helps prevent spam and phishing**

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **Adds digital signature to emails**
- **Domain-level authentication**
- **Verifies message integrity**

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
- **Builds on SPF and DKIM**
- **Provides policy and reporting**
- **Comprehensive email authentication**

## Secure Email Implementation

### Key Management
- **Symmetric keys: Generated per session**
- **Public keys: Distributed via certificates or web of trust**
- **Private keys: Securely stored on user devices**

### Performance Considerations
- **Symmetric encryption: Fast for large messages**
- **Public key encryption: Slow, used only for key exchange**
- **Hash functions: Very fast for integrity checking**

### Security Properties Achieved
- **Confidentiality: Message content is encrypted**
- **Integrity: Hash functions detect tampering**
- **Authentication: Digital signatures prove sender identity**
- **Non-repudiation: Sender cannot deny sending message**
