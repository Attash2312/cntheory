# 8.4 End-Point Authentication

## 8.4.1 Authentication Protocol ap1.0

### Basic Protocol
- **Alice says "I am Alice"**
- **Failure scenario: In a network, Bob cannot "see" Alice, so Trudy simply declares herself to be Alice**

### Problem
- **No verification mechanism**
- **Anyone can claim to be Alice**

---

## 8.4.2 Authentication Protocol ap2.0

### Enhanced Protocol
- **Alice says "I am Alice" in an IP packet containing her source IP address**
- **Failure scenario: Trudy can create a packet "spoofing" Alice's address**

### Problem
- **IP addresses can be forged**
- **No cryptographic proof of identity**

---

## 8.4.3 Authentication Protocol ap3.0

### Password-Based Protocol
- **Alice says "I am Alice" and sends her secret password to "prove" it**
- **Failure scenario: Playback attack**
  - **Trudy records Alice's packet and later plays it back to Bob**

### Problem
- **Passwords sent in plaintext**
- **Vulnerable to replay attacks**

---

## 8.4.4 Authentication Protocol ap3.1

### Encrypted Password Protocol
- **Alice says "I am Alice" and sends her encrypted secret password to "prove" it**
- **Failure scenario: Playback attack still works**
  - **Trudy records Alice's packet and later plays it back to Bob**

### Problem
- **Even encrypted passwords are vulnerable to replay**
- **No freshness guarantee**

---

## 8.4.5 Authentication Protocol ap4.0

### Nonce-Based Protocol
- **To prove Alice "live", Bob sends Alice nonce, R**
- **Alice must return R, encrypted with shared secret key**
- **Nonce: number (R) used only once-in-a-lifetime**

### Success
- **Bob knows Alice is live, and only Alice knows key to encrypt nonce, so it must be Alice!**

### Security Properties
- **Prevents replay attacks**
- **Requires shared secret key**
- **Proves liveness of Alice**

---

## 8.4.6 Authentication Protocol ap5.0

### Public Key Approach
- **ap4.0 requires shared symmetric key - can we authenticate using public key techniques?**
- **ap5.0: use nonce, public key cryptography**

### Process
1. **"I am Alice"**
2. **"Send me your public key"**
3. **Bob computes KA+(KA-(R)) = R**
4. **Bob knows only Alice could have the private key, that encrypted R such that KA+(KA-(R)) = R**

### Advantages
- **No pre-shared secret required**
- **Uses public key cryptography**

---

## 8.4.7 Authentication Protocol ap5.0 â€“ The Flaw

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack
- **Trudy poses as Alice (to Bob) and as Bob (to Alice)**

### Attack Process
1. **Trudy intercepts "I am Alice" and "Send me your public key"**
2. **Trudy sends her own public key to Bob**
3. **Bob sends R to "Alice" (actually Trudy)**
4. **Trudy encrypts R with her private key**
5. **Bob computes KT+(KT-(R)) = R, authenticating Trudy as Alice**
6. **Bob sends personal message m to "Alice"**
7. **Trudy recovers Bob's m and can read it**

### The Problem
- **No way to verify the authenticity of the public key**
- **Need for certified public keys**

## Authentication Protocol Analysis

### Protocol Comparison

| Protocol | Method | Vulnerability | Solution |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| ap1.0 | Simple claim | Impersonation | None |
| ap2.0 | IP address | IP spoofing | None |
| ap3.0 | Plaintext password | Replay attack | None |
| ap3.1 | Encrypted password | Replay attack | None |
| ap4.0 | Nonce + shared key | None | Requires shared secret |
| ap5.0 | Nonce + public key | Man-in-middle | Certificate authorities |

### Key Security Principles
- **Liveness: Prove the entity is currently active**
- **Freshness: Prevent replay attacks using nonces**
- **Authentication: Verify identity using cryptographic proof**
- **Key certification: Ensure public keys are authentic**

## More on Authentication Protocols
- **Challenge-Response:** Server sends a challenge, client proves identity by responding with a value derived from a secret.
- **Mutual Authentication:** Both client and server authenticate each other (e.g., TLS with client certificates).
- **PKI in Authentication:** Digital certificates are used to verify identities in secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, IPsec).
