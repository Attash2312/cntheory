## More on Authentication Protocols
- **Challenge-Response:** Server sends a challenge, client proves identity by responding with a value derived from a secret.
- **Mutual Authentication:** Both client and server authenticate each other (e.g., TLS with client certificates).
- **PKI in Authentication:** Digital certificates are used to verify identities in secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, IPsec).
