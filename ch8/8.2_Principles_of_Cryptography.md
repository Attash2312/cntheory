# 8.2 Principles of Cryptography

- Cryptography secures data by transforming it into unreadable form (encryption).
- Two main types: symmetric key and public key (asymmetric) cryptography.

---

## 8.2.1 Symmetric Key Cryptography
- **Same key for encryption and decryption.**
- **Examples:** AES, DES.
- **Fast, but key distribution is a challenge.**
- **Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Plaintext] -- Encrypt (Key) --> B[Ciphertext]
  B -- Decrypt (Key) --> C[Plaintext]
```

---

## 8.2.2 Public Key Encryption
- **Uses a public/private key pair.**
- **Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.**
- **Examples:** RSA, ECC.
- **Solves key distribution problem, but slower.**
- **Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Plaintext] -- Encrypt (Public Key) --> B[Ciphertext]
  B -- Decrypt (Private Key) --> C[Plaintext]
```

## Practice Questions
1. **What is the main difference between symmetric and public key cryptography?**
2. **Give an example of a symmetric and a public key algorithm.**

## Summary Table
| Type        | Key Use         | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Symmetric   | Same key        | AES     |
| Public Key  | Key pair        | RSA     |

**Exam Tips:**
- Know the difference between symmetric and public key cryptography.
- Be able to draw and explain encryption diagrams.
