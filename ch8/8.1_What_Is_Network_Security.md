# 8.1 What Is Network Security?

- Network security protects data, devices, and services from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks.
- Goals: confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad).
- Threats: eavesdropping, spoofing, DoS, malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle.

---

## Practice Questions
1. **List the three main goals of network security.**
2. **Give two examples of network security threats.**

---

## Summary Table
| Goal           | Description                |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Confidentiality| Prevent unauthorized read |
| Integrity      | Prevent unauthorized change|
| Availability   | Ensure service access     |

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know the CIA triad and common threats.
- Be able to define and give examples of each goal.

## More Types of Attacks
- **Replay Attack:** Attacker intercepts and retransmits valid data to trick the receiver.
- **Reflection Attack:** Attacker tricks a system into sending a response to itself.
- **Side-Channel Attack:** Exploits physical implementation (timing, power usage) to extract secrets.
- **Zero-Day Attack:** Exploits unknown vulnerabilities before a fix is available.

## Case Studies & Real-World Strategies

### 1. Cryptography and PKI at Scale
- **Google, Microsoft, Amazon:** Operate their own Certificate Authorities (CAs) for internal and external services. Use automated certificate management (e.g., Let's Encrypt, ACME protocol) for HTTPS at scale.
- **Banks and E-commerce:** Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and transaction signing.

### 2. TLS/SSL and Secure Web
- **Cloudflare, Google, Facebook:** Enforce HTTPS by default, use HSTS, and deploy TLS 1.3 for improved security and performance. Use certificate transparency logs to detect mis-issuance.
- **Let's Encrypt:** Provides free, automated certificates, enabling widespread HTTPS adoption.

### 3. IPsec, VPNs, and Secure Tunnels
- **Enterprises:** Use site-to-site and remote access VPNs (IPsec, SSL VPN) for secure communication between offices and remote workers.
- **Cloud Providers:** Offer managed VPN services for secure hybrid cloud and multi-cloud connectivity.

### 4. Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and DDoS Protection
- **Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield:** Provide DDoS mitigation, web application firewalls (WAF), and bot management at the edge.
- **Banks, Healthcare, Government:** Deploy multi-layered firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEM systems for compliance and threat detection.

### 5. Wireless and Endpoint Security
- **Enterprises:** Use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise, 802.1X, and RADIUS for secure WiFi. Deploy mobile device management (MDM) and endpoint protection for laptops and smartphones.
- **Retail and Hospitality:** Use network segmentation and guest WiFi isolation to protect sensitive data.

### 6. Incident Response and Threat Intelligence
- **Microsoft, Google, IBM:** Operate global security operations centers (SOCs) for 24/7 monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence sharing.
- **Financial Sector:** Participate in ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) for coordinated defense against cyber threats.
