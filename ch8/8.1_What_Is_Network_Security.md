# 8.1 What Is Network Security?

- Network security protects data, devices, and services from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks.
- Goals: confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad).
- Threats: eavesdropping, spoofing, DoS, malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle.

## What is Network Security?

### Four Key Security Goals

#### 1. Confidentiality
- **Only sender, intended receiver should "understand" message contents**
- **Sender encrypts message**
- **Receiver decrypts message**

#### 2. Authentication
- **Sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other**

#### 3. Message Integrity
- **Sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit, or afterwards) without detection**

#### 4. Access and Availability
- **Services must be accessible and available to users**

## Friends and Enemies: Alice, Bob, Trudy

### The Classic Security Model
- **Well-known in network security world**
- **Bob, Alice (lovers!) want to communicate "securely"**
- **Trudy (intruder) may intercept, delete, add messages**

### Network Components
- **Secure sender (Alice)**
- **Secure receiver (Bob)**
- **Secure channel**
- **Data, control messages**
- **Trudy (intruder)**

### Real-World Examples
**Who might Bob and Alice be?**
- **Web browser/server for electronic transactions (e.g., on-line purchases)**
- **On-line banking client/server**
- **DNS servers**
- **BGP routers exchanging routing table updates**
- **Other examples?**

## There Are Bad Guys (and Girls) Out There!

### What Can a "Bad Guy" Do?

#### 1. Eavesdrop
- **Intercept messages**

#### 2. Actively Insert Messages
- **Insert messages into connection**

#### 3. Impersonation
- **Can fake (spoof) source address in packet (or any field in packet)**

#### 4. Hijacking
- **"Take over" ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, inserting himself in place**

#### 5. Denial of Service
- **Prevent service from being used by others (e.g., by overloading resources)**

## Summary Table
| Goal           | Description                | Example                    |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Confidentiality| Prevent unauthorized read | Encryption                 |
| Integrity      | Prevent unauthorized change| Digital signatures         |
| Authentication | Verify identity            | Passwords, certificates    |
| Availability   | Ensure service access     | DDoS protection           |

**Exam Tips:**
- Know the CIA triad and common threats.
- Be able to define and give examples of each goal.
- Understand the Alice-Bob-Trudy security model.
- Know the various types of attacks and their characteristics.

---

## More Types of Attacks
- **Replay Attack:** Attacker intercepts and retransmits valid data to trick the receiver.
- **Reflection Attack:** Attacker tricks a system into sending a response to itself.
- **Side-Channel Attack:** Exploits physical implementation (timing, power usage) to extract secrets.
- **Zero-Day Attack:** Exploits unknown vulnerabilities before a fix is available.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between two parties.
- **Brute Force Attack:** Systematic attempt to guess passwords or encryption keys.

## Case Studies & Real-World Strategies

### 1. Cryptography and PKI at Scale
- **Google, Microsoft, Amazon:** Operate their own Certificate Authorities (CAs) for internal and external services. Use automated certificate management (e.g., Let's Encrypt, ACME protocol) for HTTPS at scale.
- **Banks and E-commerce:** Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and transaction signing.

### 2. TLS/SSL and Secure Web
- **Cloudflare, Google, Facebook:** Enforce HTTPS by default, use HSTS, and deploy TLS 1.3 for improved security and performance. Use certificate transparency logs to detect mis-issuance.
- **Let's Encrypt:** Provides free, automated certificates, enabling widespread HTTPS adoption.

### 3. IPsec, VPNs, and Secure Tunnels
- **Enterprises:** Use site-to-site and remote access VPNs (IPsec, SSL VPN) for secure communication between offices and remote workers.
- **Cloud Providers:** Offer managed VPN services for secure hybrid cloud and multi-cloud connectivity.

### 4. Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and DDoS Protection
- **Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield:** Provide DDoS mitigation, web application firewalls (WAF), and bot management at the edge.
- **Banks, Healthcare, Government:** Deploy multi-layered firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEM systems for compliance and threat detection.

### 5. Wireless and Endpoint Security
- **Enterprises:** Use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise, 802.1X, and RADIUS for secure WiFi. Deploy mobile device management (MDM) and endpoint protection for laptops and smartphones.
- **Retail and Hospitality:** Use network segmentation and guest WiFi isolation to protect sensitive data.

### 6. Incident Response and Threat Intelligence
- **Microsoft, Google, IBM:** Operate global security operations centers (SOCs) for 24/7 monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence sharing.
- **Financial Sector:** Participate in ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) for coordinated defense against cyber threats.
