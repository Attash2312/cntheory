# 8.8 Securing Wireless LANs

## 8.8.1 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)

### WEP Overview
- **Original 802.11 security protocol**
- **Now considered insecure and deprecated**
- **Vulnerable to various attacks**

---

## 8.8.2 IEEE 802.11i

### 802.11i Overview
- **Modern wireless security standard**
- **Basis for WPA2 and WPA3**
- **Provides strong authentication and encryption**

---

## 802.11: Authentication, Encryption

### Arriving Mobile Requirements
- **Arriving mobile must:**
  1. **Associate with access point: (establish) communication over wireless link**
  2. **Authenticate to network**

### Network Components
- **AP (Access Point)**
- **AS (Authentication Server)**
- **Wired network**
- **Mobile device**

---

## 802.11: Authentication, Encryption Process

### Step 1: Discovery of Security Capabilities
- **AP advertises its presence, forms of authentication and encryption provided**
- **Device requests specific forms authentication, encryption desired**
- **Although device, AP already exchanging messages, device not yet authenticated, does not have encryption keys**

### Step 2: Mutual Authentication and Shared Symmetric Key Derivation
- **AS, mobile already have shared common secret (e.g., password)**
- **AS, mobile use shared secret, nonces (prevent relay attacks), cryptographic hashing (ensure message integrity) to authenticating each other**
- **AS, mobile derive symmetric session key**

---

## 802.11: WPA3 Handshake

### AS Process
- **AS generates NonceAS, sends to mobile**

### Mobile Process
- **Mobile receives NonceAS**
- **Generates NonceM**
- **Generates symmetric shared session key KM-AP using NonceAS, NonceM, and initial shared secret**
- **Sends NonceM, and HMAC-signed value using NonceAS and initial shared secret**

### Key Derivation
- **AS derives symmetric shared session key KM-AP**
- **Both sides derive session key KM-AP using initial-shared-secret, NonceAS, NonceM**

### Handshake Messages
- **a: NonceAS**
- **b: NonceM, HMAC(f(KAS-M,NonceAS))**
- **c: derive session key KM-AP using initial shared secret, NonceAS, NonceM**

---

## 802.11: Authentication, Encryption (Continued)

### Step 3: Shared Symmetric Key Distribution
- **Shared symmetric session key distribution (e.g., for AES encryption)**
- **Same key derived at mobile, AS**
- **AS informs AP of the shared symmetric session**

### Step 4: Encrypted Communication
- **Encrypted communication between mobile and remote host via AP**
- **Same key derived at mobile, AS**
- **AS informs AP of the shared symmetric session**

---

## 802.11: Protocol Stack

### Authentication Protocols
- **EAP TLS**
- **EAP**
- **EAP over LAN (EAPoL)**
- **IEEE 802.11**
- **RADIUS**
- **UDP/IP**

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
- **EAP [RFC 3748] defines end-to-end request/response protocol between mobile device, AS**

---

## 802.11 Security Features

### Authentication Methods
- **Pre-shared key (PSK): Simple password-based authentication**
- **Enterprise (802.1X/EAP): Certificate-based authentication**
- **Open: No authentication (insecure)**

### Encryption Standards
- **WPA2: Uses AES-CCMP for encryption**
- **WPA3: Uses AES-GCMP for encryption**
- **WEP: RC4 encryption (deprecated)**

### Key Management
- **Four-way handshake: Establishes session keys**
- **Group key handshake: Manages broadcast/multicast keys**
- **Key hierarchy: Master key → Pairwise key → Session keys**

---

## Wireless Security Threats

### Common Attacks
- **Eavesdropping: Intercepting wireless traffic**
- **Rogue APs: Fake access points**
- **Deauthentication attacks: Forcing clients to disconnect**
- **Evil twin: Fake AP with same SSID**
- **Man-in-the-middle: Intercepting and modifying traffic**
- **WPS attacks: Exploiting Wi-Fi Protected Setup**

### Countermeasures
- **Strong authentication (802.1X)**
- **Strong encryption (AES)**
- **Regular security audits**
- **Network monitoring**
- **Client isolation**
- **MAC filtering (limited effectiveness)**

---

## WPA2 vs WPA3 Comparison

### WPA2 Features
- **AES-CCMP encryption**
- **Four-way handshake**
- **Vulnerable to KRACK attack**
- **No forward secrecy**

### WPA3 Features
- **AES-GCMP encryption**
- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**
- **Forward secrecy**
- **Enhanced protection against offline attacks**
- **192-bit security mode for enterprise**

---

## Enterprise Wireless Security

### 802.1X Authentication
- **Supplicant (client)**
- **Authenticator (AP)**
- **Authentication server (RADIUS)**
- **EAP methods: EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP**

### RADIUS Integration
- **Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service**
- **Centralized authentication**
- **User database integration**
- **Accounting and logging**
