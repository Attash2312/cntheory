# 8.6 Securing TCP Connections: SSL

- SSL/TLS secures TCP connections with encryption, authentication, and integrity.
- Used for HTTPS, email, VPNs, etc.

---

## 8.6.1 The Big Picture
- **SSL handshake:** Negotiates keys, authenticates server, establishes session.
- **Diagram:**

  A[Client] -- Hello --> B[Server]
  B -- Certificate --> A
  A -- Key Exchange --> B
  B -- Finished --> A
```

## 8.6.2 A More Complete Picture
- **Session keys:** Used for bulk data encryption.
- **Certificates:** Bind public keys to identities.
- **Integrity:** MACs ensure data not altered.

## More on TLS Handshake and Certificate Validation
- **TLS Handshake Steps:**
  1. ClientHello: Client proposes parameters.
  2. ServerHello: Server selects parameters, sends certificate.
  3. Certificate Validation: Client checks server certificate against trusted CAs.
  4. Key Exchange: Securely establish session keys.
  5. Finished: Secure session established.
- **Certificate Validation:** Checks signature, expiration, revocation, and hostname match.
