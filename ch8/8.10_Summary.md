## Chapter 8 Complete Overview

### What is Network Security?
- **Four key goals: confidentiality, authentication, message integrity, access and availability**
- **Alice, Bob, Trudy model: classic security scenario**
- **Types of attacks: eavesdrop, insert messages, impersonation, hijacking, denial of service**

### Principles of Cryptography
- **Symmetric key cryptography: same key for encryption/decryption (AES, DES)**
- **Public key cryptography: key pairs (RSA, ECC)**
- **Breaking encryption: cipher-text only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext attacks**
- **RSA: modular arithmetic, key generation, encryption/decryption process**

### Authentication and Message Integrity
- **Authentication protocols: ap1.0 through ap5.0 with increasing security**
- **Digital signatures: non-repudiation, integrity verification**
- **Message digests: hash functions (MD5, SHA-1)**
- **Certificate authorities: trusted third parties for key certification**

### Securing Email
- **Confidentiality: symmetric key + public key hybrid approach**
- **Integrity and authentication: digital signatures**
- **Complete security: combining all three properties**
- **Email protocols: PGP, S/MIME, SPF, DKIM, DMARC**

### Securing TCP Connections: TLS
- **Transport-layer security: widely deployed protocol**
- **TLS 1.3: improved security and performance**
- **Handshake process: 1-RTT and 0-RTT options**
- **Key derivation: master secret to session keys**
- **Record structure: data + MAC + length**

### Network Layer Security: IPsec
- **Two modes: transport and tunnel**
- **Two protocols: AH (authentication) and ESP (encryption)**
- **Security associations: connection-oriented security**
- **IKE: automated key exchange**
- **Datagram structure: headers, payload, authentication**

### Security in Wireless and Mobile Networks
- **802.11 authentication: four-step process**
- **WPA3 handshake: improved security over WPA2**
- **4G/5G authentication: SIM-based and certificate-based**
- **Protocol stacks: EAP, RADIUS, 802.1X**

### Operational Security: Firewalls and IDS
- **Three firewall types: stateless, stateful, application gateways**
- **Access control lists: rule-based filtering**
- **Intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based**
- **Network architecture: DMZ, VPNs, security zones**
