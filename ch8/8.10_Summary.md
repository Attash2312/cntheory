# 8.10 Summary

- Network security ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Cryptography, authentication, and firewalls are key tools.
- Secure protocols: SSL/TLS, IPsec, WPA2/WPA3, PGP.
- Management: IDS, SNMP, VPNs, certificates.

## Additional Key Points
- **Attack Types:** Replay, reflection, side-channel, zero-day.
- **Cryptographic Protocols:** Diffie-Hellman, ECC, block vs. stream ciphers.
- **PKI and Certificates:** CA, chain of trust, revocation.
- **TLS Handshake:** Steps, certificate validation.
- **IPsec Modes:** Transport vs. tunnel, AH vs. ESP.
- **VPN Types:** Site-to-site, remote access.
- **Firewalls:** Stateless, stateful, application, DMZ.
- **IDS/IPS:** Signature-based, anomaly-based, prevention.
- **Wireless Security:** WPA2, WPA3, attacks, authentication.
