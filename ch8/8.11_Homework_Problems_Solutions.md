# 8.11 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: Symmetric vs. Public Key
**Question:**
List two differences between symmetric and public key cryptography.
**Solution:**
- Symmetric: Same key, fast, key distribution problem.
- Public key: Key pair, slow, solves key distribution.

## Example 2: Hash Function Use
**Question:**
What is a cryptographic hash function used for?
**Solution:**
- Ensures message integrity, used in digital signatures and MACs.

## Example 3: SSL Handshake
**Question:**
Briefly describe the SSL handshake process.
**Solution:**
- Client and server negotiate keys, authenticate, establish session.

## Example 4: IPsec Scenario
**Question:**
How does IPsec secure a VPN connection?
**Solution:**
- Encrypts/authenticates IP packets, uses AH/ESP, creates secure tunnel.

## Example 5: Firewall vs. IDS
**Question:**
What is the main difference between a firewall and an IDS?
**Solution:**
- Firewall blocks/permits traffic; IDS detects intrusions.

## Example 6: Digital Signature Example
**Question:**
Explain how a digital signature is created and verified. Give a step-by-step example.
**Solution:**
- Sender hashes message, encrypts hash with private key (signature). Receiver decrypts with public key, compares hash to message hash.

## Example 7: DNS Security
**Question:**
How does DNSSEC improve DNS security?
**Solution:**
- Adds digital signatures to DNS records, allowing clients to verify authenticity and integrity.
