## Problem 1: RSA Key Generation
**Question:**
Bob wants to create an RSA key pair. He chooses p=11 and q=13. Calculate the public and private keys.
**Solution:**
1. n = p × q = 11 × 13 = 143
2. z = (p-1) × (q-1) = 10 × 12 = 120
3. Choose e = 7 (relatively prime to z)
4. Find d such that ed mod z = 1: 7d mod 120 = 1
   - d = 103 (7 × 103 = 721, 721 mod 120 = 1)
5. Public key: (n=143, e=7)
6. Private key: (n=143, d=103)

## Problem 2: RSA Encryption/Decryption
**Question:**
Using the keys from Problem 1, encrypt the message m=9 and then decrypt it.
**Solution:**
**Encryption:** c = m^e mod n = 9^7 mod 143 = 48
**Decryption:** m = c^d mod n = 48^103 mod 143 = 9 ✓

**Question:**
Analyze the security of authentication protocol ap3.0 (password-based). What are its vulnerabilities?
**Solution:**
**Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Plaintext password transmission** - can be intercepted
2. **Replay attack** - attacker can record and replay the authentication
3. **No freshness guarantee** - no protection against replay
4. **No mutual authentication** - only client authenticates to server

## Problem 4: TLS 1.3 Handshake
**Question:**
Compare TLS 1.3 1-RTT and 0-RTT handshakes. What are the security implications of 0-RTT?
**Solution:**
**1-RTT Handshake:**
- Client hello → Server hello → Client can send data
- 1 round trip before data transmission
- Secure against replay attacks

**0-RTT Handshake:**
- Client hello + application data → Server hello + application data
- Zero round trips for resuming connections
- **Security implications:** Vulnerable to replay attacks on application data
- Only safe for idempotent operations (GET requests)

## Problem 5: IPsec Security Analysis
**Question:**
Trudy sits between R1 and R2 in an IPsec tunnel. What can Trudy see/do and what can't she do?
**Solution:**
**What Trudy CANNOT do:**
1. **See original packet contents** - encrypted by ESP
2. **See original IP addresses** - in tunnel mode, original headers encrypted
3. **Modify packets** - MAC detects tampering
4. **Spoof R1's address** - authentication prevents this
5. **Replay packets** - sequence numbers prevent replay

**What Trudy CAN do:**
1. **See tunnel endpoints** - new IP headers visible
2. **Drop packets** - can cause denial of service
3. **See packet sizes and timing** - traffic analysis possible

## Problem 6: WPA3 Handshake Analysis
**Question:**
Explain the WPA3 handshake process and how it improves security over WPA2.
**Solution:**
**WPA3 Handshake:**
1. AS generates NonceAS, sends to mobile
2. Mobile generates NonceM and session key KM-AP
3. Mobile sends NonceM + HMAC signature
4. Both derive same session key using shared secret + nonces

**Improvements over WPA2:**
1. **Forward secrecy** - session keys not derived from long-term secrets
2. **Offline attack resistance** - no dictionary attacks possible
3. **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** - replaces 4-way handshake
4. **192-bit security mode** - for enterprise environments

**Solution:**
```
Action    Source          Dest            Protocol  Source Port  Dest Port  Flag
allow     222.22/16       outside         TCP       >1023        80         any
allow     outside         222.22/16       TCP       80           >1023      ACK
allow     222.22/16       outside         TCP       >1023        443        any
allow     outside         222.22/16       TCP       443          >1023      ACK
allow     222.22/16       outside         UDP       >1023        53         ---
allow     outside         222.22/16       UDP       53           >1023      ----
deny      all             all             all       all          all        all
```

## Problem 8: Digital Certificate Chain
**Question:**
Explain how a web browser validates a server's SSL certificate. What happens if any step fails?
**Solution:**
**Certificate Validation Process:**
1. **Extract server's public key** from certificate
2. **Verify certificate signature** using CA's public key
3. **Check certificate expiration** date
4. **Verify hostname** matches server name
5. **Check certificate revocation** (CRL/OCSP)
6. **Validate certificate chain** up to trusted root CA

**If any step fails:**
- Browser shows security warning
- User can choose to proceed (not recommended)
- Connection may be blocked entirely
- Different browsers handle failures differently

## Problem 9: Secure Email Implementation
**Question:**
Alice wants to send a confidential email to Bob with integrity and authentication. Describe the complete process.
**Solution:**
**Alice's Process:**
1. **Generate random symmetric key KS**
2. **Encrypt message with KS:** KS(message)
3. **Encrypt KS with Bob's public key:** KB+(KS)
4. **Hash message:** H(message)
5. **Sign hash with Alice's private key:** KA-(H(message))
6. **Send:** [KS(message), KB+(KS), message, KA-(H(message))]

**Bob's Process:**
1. **Decrypt KS using private key:** KB-(KB+(KS)) = KS
2. **Decrypt message:** KS(KS(message)) = message
3. **Verify signature:** KA+(KA-(H(message))) = H(message)
4. **Hash received message:** H(message)
5. **Compare hashes:** H(message) = H(message) ✓

## Problem 10: Network Security Architecture
**Question:**
Design a secure network architecture for a company with web servers, internal users, and remote workers.
**Solution:**
**Network Architecture:**
```
Internet
    |
[Firewall 1] -- DMZ -- [Web Servers, DNS, Email]
    |
[Firewall 2] -- Internal Network -- [Workstations, File Servers]
    |
[VPN Gateway] -- Remote Workers
    |
[IDS/IPS] -- Monitoring and Alerting
```

**Security Measures:**
1. **DMZ** - isolates public-facing servers
2. **Dual firewalls** - defense in depth
3. **VPN** - secure remote access
4. **IDS/IPS** - threat detection and prevention
5. **Network segmentation** - limits lateral movement
6. **Regular security updates** - patch management

## Problem 11: Cryptography Performance Analysis
**Question:**
Compare the performance characteristics of AES, RSA, and SHA-256. When would you use each?
**Solution:**
**Performance Comparison:**
| Algorithm | Speed | Key Size | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| AES | Very Fast | 128/192/256 bits | Bulk data encryption |
| RSA | Slow | 2048+ bits | Key exchange, signatures |
| SHA-256 | Very Fast | 256 bits | Integrity, hashing |

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **AES:** Encrypt large amounts of data (files, network traffic)
- **RSA:** Key exchange, digital signatures (small data)
- **SHA-256:** Password hashing, integrity checking, digital signatures

**Hybrid Approach:** Use RSA to exchange AES keys, then use AES for bulk encryption.
