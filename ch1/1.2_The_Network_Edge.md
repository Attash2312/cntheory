# 1.2 The Network Edge

- The network edge consists of devices directly interacting with users.
- **End systems:** Desktops, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices (smart thermostats, smartwatches, sensors).
- **Access networks:** Connect end systems to the Internet (wired, wireless, cellular).

---

## Types of Access Networks
- **Home networks:** DSL, cable, fiber, WiFi.
- **Enterprise networks:** Ethernet, WiFi.
- **Cellular networks:** 4G, 5G.
- **IoT networks:** Low-power wireless (Zigbee, LoRaWAN).

---

## Access Network Technologies
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):** Uses telephone lines, moderate speed.
- **Cable:** Uses coaxial cable, higher speed, shared bandwidth.
- **Fiber:** Uses optical fiber, very high speed, expensive.
- **Wireless:** WiFi (local), LTE/5G (wide area), variable speed.
