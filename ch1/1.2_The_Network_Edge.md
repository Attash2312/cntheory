# 1.2 The Network Edge

- The network edge consists of devices directly interacting with users.
- **End systems:** Desktops, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices (smart thermostats, smartwatches, sensors).
- **Access networks:** Connect end systems to the Internet (wired, wireless, cellular).

---

## Types of Access Networks
- **Home networks:** DSL, cable, fiber, WiFi.
- **Enterprise networks:** Ethernet, WiFi.
- **Cellular networks:** 4G, 5G.
- **IoT networks:** Low-power wireless (Zigbee, LoRaWAN).

---

## Access Network Technologies
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):** Uses telephone lines, moderate speed.
- **Cable:** Uses coaxial cable, higher speed, shared bandwidth.
- **Fiber:** Uses optical fiber, very high speed, expensive.
- **Wireless:** WiFi (local), LTE/5G (wide area), variable speed.

---

## Additional Access Network Types
- **Satellite:** Provides Internet to remote areas, higher latency.
- **FTTH (Fiber to the Home):** Direct fiber connection, very high speed.

| Technology | Speed         | Latency   | Use Case         |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Satellite  | 10-100 Mbps  | High      | Rural/remote    |
| FTTH       | 100 Mbps-1Gb+| Low       | Urban, premium  |

---

## Cellular Generations
- **3G:** Mobile Internet, basic web/email.
- **4G (LTE):** High-speed mobile broadband, video streaming.
- **5G:** Ultra-fast, low latency, supports IoT, smart cities.

---

## IoT and Edge Computing
- **IoT (Internet of Things):** Billions of devices (sensors, appliances, vehicles) connected to the Internet.
- **Edge Computing:** Processing data near the source (at the edge) for low latency and efficiency (e.g., smart cameras, industrial sensors).
