# 1.6 Networks Under Attack

- Networks face threats: eavesdropping, DoS, malware, spoofing, phishing, man-in-the-middle, ransomware, SQL injection.
- **Security goals:** Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non-repudiation.

---

## Network Security Context

### Internet's Original Design
- **Internet not originally designed with (much) security in mind**
- **Original vision:** "a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network" â˜º
- **Internet protocol designers playing "catch-up"**
- **Security considerations in all layers!**

### Current Security Needs
We now need to think about:
- **How bad guys can attack computer networks**
- **How we can defend networks against attacks**
- **How to design architectures that are immune to attacks**

---

## Bad Guys: Packet Interception

### Packet "Sniffing"
- **Broadcast media:** Shared Ethernet, wireless
- **Promiscuous network interface:** Reads/records all packets passing by
- **Example:** Including passwords!
- **Tools:** Wireshark software used for end-of-chapter labs is a (free) packet-sniffer

### Real-World Example
```
A sends: src:A dest:B payload
C (attacker) can read: src:A dest:B payload
```

---

## Bad Guys: Fake Identity

### IP Spoofing
- **Method:** Injection of packet with false source address
- **Example:** Attacker sends packet with source address of trusted host
- **Impact:** Can bypass access controls, launch attacks

### Real-World Example
```
A sends: src:A dest:B payload
C (attacker) sends: src:A dest:B payload (fake source)
```

---

## Bad Guys: Denial of Service

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
- **Target:** Make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic
- **Method:** Overwhelm resource with bogus traffic

### Attack Process
1. **Select target**
2. **Break into hosts around the network (see botnet)**
3. **Send packets to target from compromised hosts**

### Real-World Example: 2016 Dyn DDoS Attack
- **Target:** Dyn DNS provider
- **Method:** Botnet of IoT devices
- **Impact:** Major websites (Twitter, Netflix, Reddit) taken down
- **Scale:** 1.2 Tbps attack traffic

## Lines of Defense

### Authentication
- **Purpose:** Proving you are who you say you are
- **Cellular networks:** Provide hardware identity via SIM card
- **Traditional Internet:** No such hardware assist

### Confidentiality
- **Method:** Via encryption
- **Examples:** HTTPS, VPN, encrypted messaging

### Integrity Checks
- **Method:** Digital signatures prevent/detect tampering
- **Examples:** SSL certificates, code signing

### Access Restrictions
- **Method:** Password-protected VPNs
- **Examples:** Corporate VPNs, secure remote access

### Firewalls
- **Specialized "middleboxes"** in access and core networks
- **Off-by-default:** Filter incoming packets to restrict senders, receivers, applications
- **Functions:** Detecting/reacting to DOS attacks
- **Examples:** Network firewalls, host firewalls, application firewalls

---

## Common Attack Types
- **Eavesdropping:** Intercepting data (sniffers).
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading resources.
- **Malware:** Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware.
- **Spoofing:** Impersonating another device/user.
- **Phishing:** Tricking users to reveal info.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** Attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication.
- **SQL injection:** Injecting malicious code into database queries.

---

## Security Goals Explained
- **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized access to data.
- **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized modification of data.
- **Availability:** Ensure services are accessible.
- **Authentication:** Verify identity of users/devices.
- **Non-repudiation:** Prevent denial of actions.
