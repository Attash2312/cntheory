# 1.6 Networks Under Attack

- Networks face threats: eavesdropping, DoS, malware, spoofing, phishing, man-in-the-middle, ransomware, SQL injection.
- **Security goals:** Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non-repudiation.

---

## Common Attack Types
- **Eavesdropping:** Intercepting data (sniffers).
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading resources.
- **Malware:** Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware.
- **Spoofing:** Impersonating another device/user.
- **Phishing:** Tricking users to reveal info.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** Attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication.
- **SQL injection:** Injecting malicious code into database queries.

---

## Security Goals Explained
- **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized access to data.
- **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized modification of data.
- **Availability:** Ensure services are accessible.
- **Authentication:** Verify identity of users/devices.
- **Non-repudiation:** Prevent denial of actions.
