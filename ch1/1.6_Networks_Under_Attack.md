# 1.6 Networks Under Attack

Computer networks are vulnerable to various types of attacks that can compromise security, privacy, and availability.

---

## Types of Network Attacks

- **Malware:** Malicious software (viruses, worms, trojans) that infects computers.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Attackers flood a network or server with traffic to make it unavailable.
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.
- **Packet Sniffing:** Intercepting and reading data packets as they travel across the network.
- **Spoofing:** Pretending to be another device or user on the network.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.

## Security Measures

- **Encryption:** Protects data in transit (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs)
- **Firewalls:** Block unauthorized access
- **Authentication:** Verifies user identity
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Monitor for suspicious activity

**Exam Tip:**
- Be able to describe common network attacks and basic security measures, and draw simple attack diagrams.
