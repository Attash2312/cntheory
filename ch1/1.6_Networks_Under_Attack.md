# 1.6 Networks Under Attack

- Networks face threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Attacks can target users, devices, or infrastructure.

---

## Types of Network Attacks

- **Malware:** Viruses, worms, trojans infect computers.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Flooding a server to make it unavailable.
- **Distributed DoS (DDoS):** Many devices attack at once.
- **Phishing:** Fake emails/websites to steal information.
- **Packet Sniffing:** Intercepting data in transit.
- **Spoofing:** Pretending to be another device/user.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Intercepting and altering communication.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data, demands payment.
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious code in database queries.
- **Example:** DDoS attack on a bank website using a botnet.

## Security Measures

- **Encryption:** HTTPS, VPNs
- **Firewalls:** Block unauthorized access
- **Authentication:** Passwords, biometrics
- **IDS/IPS:** Intrusion detection/prevention systems
- **Regular Updates:** Patch vulnerabilities
- **User Education:** Avoid phishing/social engineering

**Exam Tip:**
- Know attack types, examples, and security measures.
- Draw attack diagrams and use summary tables for revision.
