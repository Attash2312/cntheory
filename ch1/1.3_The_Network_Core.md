# 1.3 The Network Core

- The network core is the Internet's backbone, moving data between edge networks.
- Consists of routers, high-speed links, and switching techniques.

## 1.3.1 Packet Switching

- Data split into packets, each routed independently.
- Routers forward packets based on destination address.
- **Advantages:** Efficient, robust, scalable.
- **Disadvantages:** Variable delay, possible congestion.
- **Scenario:** Multiple users share the same link; packets from different sources interleave.

## 1.3.2 Circuit Switching

- Dedicated path for each session (e.g., phone call).
- **Advantages:** Predictable performance, constant bandwidth.
- **Disadvantages:** Inefficient if idle, not scalable for bursty data.
- **Scenario:** Traditional telephone network reserves a line for the entire call.

## 1.3.3 A Network of Networks

- The Internet is a hierarchy of interconnected networks (ISPs, enterprise, campus, etc.).
- **Example:** Your home network connects to a local ISP, which connects to a regional ISP, then to a global backbone.

**Comparison Table:**
| Feature           | Packet Switching      | Circuit Switching     |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Resource Sharing  | Yes                  | No                   |
| Delay             | Variable             | Fixed                |
| Efficiency        | High (bursty data)   | Low (idle waste)     |
| Example           | Internet             | Telephone network    |

**Exam Tip:**
- Compare packet and circuit switching with examples and tables.
- Draw hierarchical network diagrams.
