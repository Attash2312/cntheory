# 1.8 Summary

- The Internet is a global network of networks, using protocols to enable communication between devices.
- The network edge consists of end systems and access networks; the core is made up of routers and high-speed links.
- Packet switching and circuit switching are two fundamental switching techniques.
- Network performance is measured by delay, loss, and throughput.
- The Internet uses a layered protocol architecture (Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical).
- Security threats include malware, DoS, phishing, sniffing, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- The Internet evolved from ARPANET and proprietary networks to today's global, commercial, and mobile Internet.
