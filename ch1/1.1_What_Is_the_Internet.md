# 1.1 What Is the Internet?

- The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices.
- Provides communication, resource sharing, and access to information.
- **Key components:** hosts (end systems), routers, links, protocols.
- **Internet standards:** Defined by IETF (RFCs).

---

## Real-World Analogy
- The Internet is like a postal system: computers (houses) send/receive messages (letters) via routers (post offices) using protocols (postal rules).

---

## Real-World Scenarios
- Sending an email from your phone to a friend in another country involves your device, your ISP, multiple routers, and the recipient's ISP and device.
- Streaming a video on YouTube involves DNS lookup, HTTP requests, and data transfer from servers across the globe.

---

## Internet vs. World Wide Web
- **Internet:** The physical network of networks (hardware, routers, links).
- **World Wide Web (WWW):** A service on the Internet that uses HTTP to access web pages.
