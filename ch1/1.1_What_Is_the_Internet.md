---

## Real-World Scenarios
- Sending an email from your phone to a friend in another country involves your device, your ISP, multiple routers, and the recipient's ISP and device.
- Streaming a video on YouTube involves DNS lookup, HTTP requests, and data transfer from servers across the globe.

---

## Internet vs. World Wide Web
- **Internet:** The physical network of networks (hardware, routers, links).
- **World Wide Web (WWW):** A service on the Internet that uses HTTP to access web pages.
