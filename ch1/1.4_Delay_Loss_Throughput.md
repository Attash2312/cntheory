# 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

- Network performance is measured by delay, loss, and throughput.
- Delays can be calculated and analyzed for exam numericals.

## 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks

- **Processing Delay:** Time to examine packet header (microseconds or less).
- **Queuing Delay:** Time waiting in queue (varies with congestion).
- **Transmission Delay:**
  - Formula: Transmission Delay = Packet Length (bits) / Link Bandwidth (bps)
- **Propagation Delay:**
  - Formula: Propagation Delay = Link Length (meters) / Propagation Speed (m/s)
- **Example:** 1,500-byte packet on 10 Mbps link: 1,500*8/10^7 = 1.2 ms

## 1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss

- **Queuing Delay:** Increases with traffic load.
- **Packet Loss:** Occurs when buffer is full; packets dropped.
- **Scenario:** Video call lags when network is congested.

## 1.4.3 End-to-End Delay

- **Total Delay:** Sum of all delays on the path.
- **Formula:** End-to-End Delay = N*(d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop)
- **Example:** 2 links, each with 2 ms processing, 3 ms queuing, 4 ms transmission, 5 ms propagation:
  - Total = 2*(2+3+4+5) = 28 ms

## 1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks

- **Throughput:** Rate of successful data delivery (bps).
- **Instantaneous vs. Average Throughput:**
- **Bottleneck Link:** Slowest link limits throughput.
- **Example:** 3 links: 10 Mbps, 5 Mbps, 2 Mbps â†’ Throughput = 2 Mbps

**Summary Table:**
| Delay Type         | Formula/Description                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Processing Delay   | Time to process header                     |
| Queuing Delay      | Time in queue (varies)                     |
| Transmission Delay | Packet size / Bandwidth                    |
| Propagation Delay  | Link length / Propagation speed            |
| Throughput         | Limited by slowest (bottleneck) link       |

**Exam Tip:**
- Practice delay and throughput numericals.
- Draw diagrams for delay and bottleneck scenarios.
