# 1.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: Calculating Transmission Delay

**Question:**
A 1,000-byte packet is sent over a link with a bandwidth of 1 Mbps. What is the transmission delay?

**Solution:**
- Packet size = 1,000 bytes = 8,000 bits
- Bandwidth = 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps
- Transmission Delay = Packet Size / Bandwidth = 8,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.008 seconds = 8 ms

## Example 2: End-to-End Delay

**Question:**
A packet traverses 2 links. Each link has a processing delay of 1 ms, queuing delay of 2 ms, transmission delay of 3 ms, and propagation delay of 4 ms. What is the total end-to-end delay?

**Solution:**
- Total Delay = 2 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 2 × 10 = 20 ms

## Example 3: Identifying the Bottleneck Link

**Question:**
A data path consists of three links with bandwidths 10 Mbps, 5 Mbps, and 2 Mbps. What is the end-to-end throughput?

**Solution:**
- The slowest link determines throughput: 2 Mbps

## Example 4: Protocol Layer Identification

**Question:**
At which layer does IP operate? What about HTTP?

**Solution:**
- IP: Network Layer
- HTTP: Application Layer

## Example 5: Scenario - Man-in-the-Middle Attack

**Question:**
Describe a man-in-the-middle attack and one way to prevent it.

**Solution:**
- An attacker intercepts communication between two parties, possibly altering the data.
- Prevention: Use encryption (e.g., HTTPS) to secure communication.
