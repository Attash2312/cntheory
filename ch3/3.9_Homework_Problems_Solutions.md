# 3.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: UDP Use Case
**Question:**
Why is UDP preferred for live video streaming?
**Solution:**
- Low overhead, tolerates some loss, faster delivery.

## Example 2: TCP Three-Way Handshake
**Question:**
Describe the steps of the TCP three-way handshake.
**Solution:**
- SYN: Client requests connection
- SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and responds
- ACK: Client confirms

## Example 3: RDT Protocols
**Question:**
How does rdt3.0 handle packet loss?
**Solution:**
- Uses timeouts and retransmissions for lost packets.

## Example 4: Congestion Window
**Question:**
Draw and explain the behavior of the TCP congestion window during slow start and congestion avoidance.
**Solution:**
- Exponential growth (slow start), linear growth (avoidance), drop on loss.

## Example 5: Multiplexing
**Question:**
What is the purpose of port numbers in multiplexing/demultiplexing?
**Solution:**
- Identify applications/endpoints for correct data delivery.

---

## Example 6: Sequence Numbers
**Question:**
Why are sequence numbers important in TCP?
**Solution:**
- Ensure correct ordering and reliable delivery of data segments.

## Example 7: Go-Back-N vs. Selective Repeat
**Question:**
Compare Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ protocols.
**Solution:**
- Go-Back-N: Retransmits from error onward, simpler, less buffer.
- Selective Repeat: Only retransmits lost packets, more efficient, more buffer needed.
