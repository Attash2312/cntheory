**Solution:**
- Uses timeouts and retransmissions for lost packets.

---

**Question:**
Draw and explain the behavior of the TCP congestion window during slow start and congestion avoidance.
**Solution:**
- Exponential growth (slow start), linear growth (avoidance), drop on loss.

---

## Example 5: Multiplexing
**Question:**
What is the purpose of port numbers in multiplexing/demultiplexing?
**Solution:**
- Identify applications/endpoints for correct data delivery.

---

---

## Example 7: Go-Back-N vs. Selective Repeat
**Question:**
Compare Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ protocols.
**Solution:**
- Go-Back-N: Retransmits from error onward, simpler, less buffer.
- Selective Repeat: Only retransmits lost packets, more efficient, more buffer needed.

---

## Example 8: TCP Flow Control
**Question:**
How does TCP implement flow control?
**Solution:**
- Receiver advertises window size in rwnd field
- Sender limits unacknowledged data to received rwnd
- Prevents receiver buffer overflow

---

## Example 9: AIMD Algorithm
**Question:**
Explain the AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease) algorithm used in TCP congestion control.
**Solution:**
- Additive Increase: Window grows linearly (by 1 MSS per RTT)
- Multiplicative Decrease: Window halves on loss detection
- Provides fairness and stability

---

## Example 10: TCP Fast Retransmit
**Question:**
When does TCP use fast retransmit instead of waiting for a timeout?
**Solution:**
- When sender receives 3 duplicate ACKs for same data
- Indicates packet loss, triggers immediate retransmission
- Faster recovery than waiting for timeout

---

## Example 11: QUIC vs TCP
**Question:**
What are the advantages of QUIC over TCP for HTTP/3?
**Solution:**
- Single handshake (vs TCP+TLS)
- No HOL blocking between streams
- Better performance on lossy networks
- Built-in encryption

---

## Example 12: ECN
**Question:**
How does Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) improve network performance?
**Solution:**
- Routers mark packets instead of dropping them
- Endpoints reduce rate before loss occurs
- Reduces packet loss and improves throughput

---

## Example 13: TCP CUBIC
**Question:**
Why is TCP CUBIC preferred over classic TCP for high-speed networks?
**Solution:**
- Uses cubic window growth function
- Better bandwidth utilization on high-speed links
- Default in Linux and popular web servers

---

## Example 14: RTT Estimation
**Question:**
How does TCP estimate round-trip time for timeout calculation?
**Solution:**
- SampleRTT: measured time from transmission to ACK
- EstimatedRTT = (1-α)*EstimatedRTT + α*SampleRTT
- TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4*DevRTT

---

## Example 15: TCP Fairness
**Question:**
Under what conditions does TCP achieve fair bandwidth sharing?
**Solution:**
- Same RTT for competing flows
- Fixed number of sessions
- Only in congestion avoidance phase
- No UDP flows or misbehaving TCP

### Problem 4: RDT Protocol Design
Design a simple rdt protocol that handles bit errors but not packet loss.

### Problem 5: Multiplexing Scenario
A server has three TCP connections from different clients. Explain how the server demultiplexes incoming segments to the correct connection.

## Exam-Style Questions

### Question 1: Transport Layer Services
**Q:** Compare and contrast the services provided by TCP and UDP. Give specific examples of applications that use each protocol.

**A:**
