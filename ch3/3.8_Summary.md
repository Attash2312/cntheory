# 3.8 Summary

- The transport layer provides logical communication, reliability, and flow/congestion control.
- Key protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable).
- Concepts: multiplexing, RDT, congestion control, AIMD.

## Chapter 3: Summary

### Principles Behind Transport Layer Services
- **Multiplexing, demultiplexing**
- **Reliable data transfer**
- **Flow control**
- **Congestion control**

### Instantiation, Implementation in the Internet
- **UDP**
- **TCP**

### Up Next
- **Leaving the network "edge" (application, transport layers)**
- **Into the network "core"**
- **Two network-layer chapters:**
  - Data plane
  - Control plane

## Evolution of Transport-Layer Functionality

### TCP, UDP: Principal Transport Protocols for 40 Years
- **Different "flavors" of TCP developed, for specific scenarios:**
  - **Long, fat pipes (large data transfers):** Many packets "in flight"; loss shuts down pipeline
  - **Wireless networks:** Loss due to noisy wireless links, mobility; TCP treat this as congestion loss
  - **Long-delay links:** Extremely long RTTs
  - **Data center networks:** Latency sensitive
  - **Background traffic flows:** Low priority, "background" TCP flows

### Moving Transport–Layer Functions to Application Layer, on Top of UDP
- **HTTP/3: QUIC**

## QUIC: Quick UDP Internet Connections

### Application-Layer Protocol, on Top of UDP
- **Increase performance of HTTP**
- **Deployed on many Google servers, apps (Chrome, mobile YouTube app)**

### Protocol Stack Comparison
- **HTTP/2 over TCP:** IP → TCP → TLS → HTTP/2
- **HTTP/3:** IP → UDP → QUIC → HTTP/2 (slimmed)

### QUIC Characteristics
- **Adopts approaches we've studied in this chapter for connection establishment, error control, congestion control**
- **Multiple application-level "streams" multiplexed over single QUIC connection**
- **Separate reliable data transfer, security**
- **Common congestion control**
- **Error and congestion control:** "Readers familiar with TCP's loss detection and congestion control will find algorithms here that parallel well-known TCP ones." [from QUIC specification]
- **Connection establishment:** Reliability, congestion control, authentication, encryption, state established in one RTT

## QUIC: Connection Establishment

### TCP Handshake vs QUIC Handshake
- **TCP handshake (transport layer) + TLS handshake (security) = 2 serial handshakes**
- **QUIC handshake = 1 handshake**
- **QUIC:** Reliability, congestion control, authentication, crypto state

---

## QUIC: Streams - Parallelism, No HOL Blocking

### HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP/2 with QUIC
- **HTTP 1.1:** TCP RDT → TCP Cong. Contr. → TLS encryption → HTTP
- **HTTP/2 with QUIC:** QUIC Cong. Cont. → QUIC encrypt → QUIC RDT → UDP → HTTP
- **No HOL blocking:** Error in one stream doesn't block others

## Quick Revision Table
| Concept      | Key Point / Example         |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| TCP          | Reliable, ordered, flow ctrl|
| UDP          | Unreliable, fast           |
| RDT          | ACK, NAK, timeouts         |
| Congestion   | TCP slow start, AIMD       |
| Multiplexing | Ports, sockets             |

**Exam Tips:**
- Focus on protocol features and mechanisms.
- Practice drawing diagrams and explaining algorithms.
