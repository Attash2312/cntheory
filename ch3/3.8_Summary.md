# 3.8 Summary

- The transport layer provides logical communication, reliability, and flow/congestion control.
- Key protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable).
- Concepts: multiplexing, RDT, congestion control, AIMD.

## Quick Revision Table
| Concept      | Key Point / Example         |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| TCP          | Reliable, ordered, flow ctrl|
| UDP          | Unreliable, fast           |
| RDT          | ACK, NAK, timeouts         |
| Congestion   | TCP slow start, AIMD       |
| Multiplexing | Ports, sockets             |

**Exam Tips:**
- Focus on protocol features and mechanisms.
- Practice drawing diagrams and explaining algorithms.
