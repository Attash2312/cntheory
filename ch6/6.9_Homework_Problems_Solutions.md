# 6.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: CRC Calculation
**Question:**
How does CRC detect errors in a frame?
**Solution:**
- Uses polynomial division; receiver checks if remainder matches CRC bits.

---

## Example 2: CSMA/CD Scenario
**Question:**
Why is CSMA/CD not used in WiFi?
**Solution:**
- Wireless cannot detect collisions reliably; uses CSMA/CA instead.

---

## Example 3: VLAN Use Case
**Question:**
How do VLANs improve network security?
**Solution:**
- Isolate traffic, limit broadcast domains, control access.

---

## Example 4: MPLS vs. IP Routing
**Question:**
How does MPLS differ from traditional IP routing?
**Solution:**
- Uses labels for fast, flexible forwarding instead of IP lookups.

## Example 5: Data Center Topology
**Question:**
Draw and explain a fat-tree topology for a data center.
**Solution:**
- Multiple layers (core, aggregation, edge), redundant paths for reliability and scalability.

---

## Example 6: Hamming Code Example
**Question:**
Given a 4-bit data word, show how Hamming code can be used to detect and correct a single-bit error. (Provide step-by-step encoding and error correction.)
**Solution:**
- [Show Hamming code construction, parity bits, and error correction process.]

## Example 7: Token Ring vs. Ethernet
**Question:**
Compare Token Ring and Ethernet in terms of access method and collision handling.
**Solution:**
- Token Ring: Token passing, no collisions. Ethernet: CSMA/CD, collisions possible.
