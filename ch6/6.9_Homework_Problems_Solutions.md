# 6.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1: Error Detection and CRC
**Question:** Calculate the CRC for data D = 110101 using generator G = 1011. Show all steps.

**Solution:**
1. **Append r zeros to D: D.2r = 110101000 (r = 3)**
2. **Divide 110101000 by 1011 using modulo-2 arithmetic:**
   ```
   110101000 ÷ 1011 = 111000 remainder 100
   ```
3. **Remainder R = 100**
4. **Transmitted frame = 110101100**

**Verification:** Receiver divides 110101100 by 1011, gets remainder 0 (no errors).

## Problem 4: ARP Table Management
**Question:** A host with IP 192.168.1.5 wants to send a packet to 192.168.1.10. The ARP table shows:
- 192.168.1.10 → 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
- 192.168.1.1 → 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE

What happens if the destination MAC address is not in the ARP table?

**Solution:**
1. **Host broadcasts ARP query: "Who has 192.168.1.10?"**
2. **Destination host responds with its MAC address**
3. **Host updates ARP table and sends packet**
4. **If no response, packet is dropped**

- Data: 46 bytes
- CRC: 4 bytes

What type of frame is this and what does it contain?

**Solution:**
- **This is a broadcast frame (destination = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)**
- **Type 0x0800 indicates IP protocol**
- **Contains an IP packet (likely ARP or DHCP)**
- **Total frame size = 6+6+2+46+4 = 64 bytes (minimum Ethernet frame)**

A frame arrives from Port 2 with source MAC 99:88:77:66:55:44 and destination MAC AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. What does the switch do?

**Solution:**
1. **Learns: 99:88:77:66:55:44 → Port 2 (updates table)**

Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name Engineering
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# vlan 30
Switch(config-vlan)# name Management
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# interface range fa0/1-3
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if-range)# exit

Switch(config)# interface range fa0/4-6
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if-range)# exit

Switch(config)# interface range fa0/7-8
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access

Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

## Problem 8: MPLS Label Stacking
**Question:** An MPLS packet has the following label stack:
- Label 1: 100 (top of stack)
- Label 2: 200 (bottom of stack)

The packet arrives at a router with forwarding table:
- Incoming label 100 → Outgoing label 150, Interface 1
- Incoming label 200 → Outgoing label 250, Interface 2

What happens to the packet?

**Solution:**
- **Router processes top label (100)**
- **Replaces label 100 with label 150**
- **Forwards packet out Interface 1**
- **Label 200 remains unchanged in stack**

## Problem 9: Data Center Topology Design
**Question:** Design a spine-leaf topology for a data center with 48 servers. Each leaf switch can connect 24 servers, and each spine switch can connect to all leaf switches.

**Solution:**
- **Number of leaf switches = 48 servers ÷ 24 servers/switch = 2 leaf switches**
- **Each leaf switch connects to all spine switches**
- **Minimum 2 spine switches for redundancy**
- **Total connections: 2 leaf × 2 spine = 4 spine-leaf connections**
- **Each server connects to one leaf switch**

- **P(success) = 10 × 0.1 × (1-0.1)9**
- **P(success) = 1 × 0.99 = 0.387**
- **Efficiency = 38.7%**
