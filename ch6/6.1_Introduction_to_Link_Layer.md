# 6.1 Introduction to the Link Layer

- The link layer is responsible for data transfer between directly connected nodes.
- **Key functions:** Framing, error detection, medium access control (MAC), addressing.
- **Protocols:** Ethernet, WiFi, PPP, ARP.

---

## Real-World Analogy
- The link layer is like a local delivery truck: it picks up and drops off packages (frames) within a neighborhood (local network).

## Summary Table
| Function   | Description                  |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Framing    | Encapsulate data in frames   |
| Error Det. | Detect/correct errors        |
| MAC        | Control access to medium     |
| Addressing | Identify devices (MAC addr)  |

## Practice Questions
1. **What is the main function of the link layer?**
2. **Give a real-world analogy for the link layer.**
3. **List two link layer protocols.**

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know the key functions and protocols of the link layer.
- Be able to draw and explain the link layer's role in the stack.

## Classic LAN Topologies
- **Star:** All devices connect to a central switch/hub. Easy to manage, but central point of failure.
- **Bus:** All devices share a single communication line. Simple, but collisions and troubleshooting issues.
- **Ring:** Devices form a closed loop. Predictable, but break in ring affects all.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Star
    A1[Device] -- Hub --> H1[Hub]
    A2[Device] -- Hub --> H1
    A3[Device] -- Hub --> H1
  end
  subgraph Bus
    B1[Device] -- Bus --> B2[Device]
    B2 -- Bus --> B3[Device]
  end
  subgraph Ring
    C1[Device] -- Ring --> C2[Device]
    C2 -- Ring --> C3[Device]
    C3 -- Ring --> C1
  end
```

| Topology | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Star     | Easy to manage, scalable | Hub/switch failure = network down |
| Bus      | Cheap, simple            | Collisions, hard to troubleshoot |
| Ring     | Predictable, orderly     | Break = all down |

## Ethernet Evolution
- **10Base-T:** 10 Mbps, twisted pair.
- **100Base-TX:** 100 Mbps, twisted pair.
- **Gigabit Ethernet:** 1 Gbps, twisted pair/fiber.
- **10G/40G/100G Ethernet:** High-speed, data centers/backbones.

## Case Studies & Real-World Strategies

### 1. Ethernet Evolution and High-Speed LANs
- **Google, Facebook, Microsoft:** Deploy 10G/40G/100G Ethernet in data centers for high bandwidth and low latency. Use fiber and copper based on distance and cost.
- **Financial Firms:** Use low-latency Ethernet and cut-through switching for high-frequency trading.

### 2. Switching and VLANs
- **Large Enterprises:** Use VLANs to segment networks for security, performance, and compliance. Employ Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Rapid STP to prevent loops and enable fast failover.
- **Cloud Providers:** Automate VLAN provisioning and use VXLAN for scalable virtual networks across data centers.

### 3. WiFi and Wireless LANs
- **Universities, Airports, Stadiums:** Deploy dense WiFi networks with multiple access points, seamless roaming, and load balancing. Use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise for secure authentication.
- **Google and Amazon:** Use WiFi 6/6E in offices and warehouses for high device density and IoT support.

### 4. Data Center Networking
- **Amazon, Google, Microsoft:** Use fat-tree and spine-leaf topologies for scalable, redundant, and high-performance data center networks. Employ SDN for automated traffic engineering and rapid scaling.
- **Netflix Open Connect:** Deploys custom switches and high-capacity links in ISP data centers to optimize video delivery.

### 5. Link Virtualization and MPLS
- **ISPs:** Use MPLS for traffic engineering, VPNs, and fast reroute in WANs. Enterprises use PPP and HDLC for secure point-to-point links in legacy WANs.
