# 6.4 Switched LANs

- Switched LANs use switches to connect multiple devices in a local network.
- **Ethernet:** Most common LAN technology.
- **Switches:** Forward frames based on MAC addresses.
- **VLANs:** Virtual LANs segment networks logically.

---

## MAC Addresses and ARP

### 32-bit IP Address
- **Network-layer address for interface**
- **Used for layer 3 (network layer) forwarding**

### MAC (or LAN or Physical or Ethernet) Address
- **Function: used 'locally" to get frame from one interface to another physically-connected interface (same network, in IP-addressing sense)**
- **48 bit MAC address (for most LANs) burned in NIC ROM, also sometimes software settable**
- **Example: 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD**
- **Hexadecimal (base 16) notation (each "numeral" represents 4 bits)**

---

## LAN Addresses and ARP

### Each Adapter on LAN Has Unique LAN Address
- **Adapter addresses:**
  - **1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD**
  - **58-23-D7-FA-20-B0**
  - **0C-C4-11-6F-E3-98**
  - **71-65-F7-2B-08-53**

### LAN (Wired or Wireless) Network

---

## LAN Addresses (More)

### MAC Address Allocation
- **Administered by IEEE**
- **Manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (to assure uniqueness)**

### Analogy
- **MAC address: like Social Security Number**
- **IP address: like postal address**

### Characteristics
- **MAC flat address ➜ portability**
  - **Can move LAN card from one LAN to another**
- **IP hierarchical address not portable**
  - **Address depends on IP subnet to which node is attached**

---

## ARP: Address Resolution Protocol

### ARP Table
- **Each IP node (host, router) on LAN has table**
- **IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes:**
  - **< IP address; MAC address; TTL>**
- **TTL (Time To Live): time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20 min)**

### Question
- **How to determine interface's MAC address, knowing its IP address?**

### Example Network
- **LAN with IP addresses:**
  - **137.196.7.23**
  - **137.196.7.78**
  - **137.196.7.14**
  - **137.196.7.88**

---

## ARP Protocol: Same LAN

### ARP Process
1. **A wants to send datagram to B**
2. **B's MAC address not in A's ARP table**
3. **A broadcasts ARP query packet, containing B's IP address**
   - **Destination MAC address = FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF**
4. **All nodes on LAN receive ARP query**
5. **B receives ARP packet, replies to A with its (B's) MAC address**
   - **Frame sent to A's MAC address (unicast)**
6. **A caches (saves) IP-to-MAC address pair in its ARP table until information becomes old (times out)**

### Characteristics
- **Soft state: information that times out (goes away) unless refreshed**
- **ARP is "plug-and-play":**
  - **Nodes create their ARP tables without intervention from net administrator**

---

## Addressing: Routing to Another LAN

### Walkthrough: Send Datagram from A to B via R
- **Focus on addressing – at IP (datagram) and MAC layer (frame)**
- **Assume A knows B's IP address**
- **Assume A knows IP address of first hop router, R (how?)**
- **Assume A knows R's MAC address (how?)**

### Network Topology
- **Router R: 1A-23-F9-CD-06-9B, 222.222.222.220, 111.111.111.110**
- **Host A: 74-29-9C-E8-FF-55, 111.111.111.111**
- **Host B: 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A, 222.222.222.222**

---

## Step-by-Step Routing Process

### Step 1: A Creates IP Datagram
- **IP src: 111.111.111.111**
- **IP dest: 222.222.222.222**
- **A creates IP datagram with IP source A, destination B**
- **A creates link-layer frame with R's MAC address as destination address, frame contains A-to-B IP datagram**
- **MAC src: 74-29-9C-E8-FF-55**
- **MAC dest: E6-E9-00-17-BB-4B**

### Step 2: Frame Sent from A to R
- **Frame sent from A to R**
- **Frame received at R, datagram removed, passed up to IP**

### Step 3: R Forwards Datagram
- **R forwards datagram with IP source A, destination B**
- **R creates link-layer frame with B's MAC address as destination address, frame contains A-to-B IP datagram**
- **MAC src: 1A-23-F9-CD-06-9B**
- **MAC dest: 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A**

### Step 4: Frame Sent to B
- **R forwards datagram with IP source A, destination B**
- **R creates link-layer frame with B's MAC address as dest, frame contains A-to-B IP datagram**

## Ethernet

### "Dominant" Wired LAN Technology
- **Single chip, multiple speeds (e.g., Broadcom BCM5761)**
- **First widely used LAN technology**
- **Simpler, cheap**
- **Kept up with speed race: 10 Mbps – 10 Gbps**
- **Metcalfe's Ethernet sketch**

---

## Ethernet: Physical Topology

### Bus Topology (Popular Through Mid 90s)
- **All nodes in same collision domain (can collide with each other)**

### Star Topology (Prevails Today)
- **Active switch in center**
- **Each "spoke" runs a (separate) Ethernet protocol (nodes do not collide with each other)**

### Comparison
- **Bus: coaxial cable**
- **Star: switch-based**

---

## Ethernet Frame Structure

### Sending Adapter Encapsulates IP Datagram
- **Sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram (or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame**

### Frame Components
- **Preamble:**
  - **7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by one byte with pattern 10101011**
  - **Used to synchronize receiver, sender clock rates**
- **Dest. address**
- **Source address**
- **Type**
- **Data (payload)**
- **CRC**

---

## Ethernet Frame Structure (More)

### Addresses
- **6 byte source, destination MAC addresses**
- **If adapter receives frame with matching destination address, or with broadcast address (e.g. ARP packet), it passes data in frame to network layer protocol**
- **Otherwise, adapter discards frame**

### Type Field
- **Indicates higher layer protocol (mostly IP but others possible, e.g., Novell IPX, AppleTalk)**

### CRC
- **Cyclic redundancy check at receiver**
- **Error detected: frame is dropped**

---

## Ethernet: Unreliable, Connectionless

### Connectionless
- **No handshaking between sending and receiving NICs**

### Unreliable
- **Receiving NIC doesn't send acks or nacks to sending NIC**
- **Data in dropped frames recovered only if initial sender uses higher layer rdt (e.g., TCP), otherwise dropped data lost**

### MAC Protocol
- **Ethernet's MAC protocol: unslotted CSMA/CD with binary backoff**

---

## 802.3 Ethernet Standards: Link & Physical Layers

### Characteristics
- **Transparent**
  - **Hosts are unaware of presence of switches**
- **Plug-and-play, self-learning**
  - **Switches do not need to be configured**

---

## Switch: Multiple Simultaneous Transmissions

### Hosts Have Dedicated, Direct Connection to Switch
- **Switches buffer packets**
- **Ethernet protocol used on each incoming link, but no collisions; full duplex**
- **Each link is its own collision domain**

### Switching
- **A-to-A' and B-to-B' can transmit simultaneously, without collisions**

### Example
- **Switch with six interfaces (1,2,3,4,5,6)**
- **Hosts A, A', B, B', C, C'**

---

## Switch Forwarding Table

### Question
- **How does switch know A' reachable via interface 4, B' reachable via interface 5?**

### Answer
- **Each switch has a switch table, each entry:**
  - **(MAC address of host, interface to reach host, time stamp)**
- **Looks like a routing table!**

### Question
- **How are entries created, maintained in switch table?**
- **Something like a routing protocol?**

---

## Switch: Self-Learning

### Switch Learns Which Hosts Can Be Reached Through Which Interfaces
- **When frame received, switch "learns" location of sender: incoming LAN segment**
- **Records sender/location pair in switch table**

### Example
- **Source: A**
- **Dest: A'**
- **MAC addr interface TTL**
- **Switch table (initially empty)**
- **A 1 60**

---

## Switch: Frame Filtering/Forwarding

### When Frame Received at Switch
1. **Record incoming link, MAC address of sending host**
2. **Index switch table using MAC destination address**
3. **If entry found for destination then:**
   - **If destination on segment from which frame arrived then drop frame**
   - **Else forward frame on interface indicated by entry**
4. **Else flood (forward on all interfaces except arriving interface)**

---

## Self-Learning, Forwarding: Example

### Frame Destination Unknown
- **Frame destination, A', location unknown: flood**

### Frame Destination Known
- **Destination A location known: A' 4 60**
- **Selectively send on just one link**

### Example Flow
- **A A' (multiple times)**
- **Switch table updates**
- **Selective forwarding**

---

## Interconnecting Switches

### Self-Learning Switches Can Be Connected Together
- **Question: sending from A to G - how does S1 know to forward frame destined to G via S4 and S3?**
- **Answer: self learning! (works exactly the same as in single-switch case!)**

### Network Topology
- **Switches S1, S2, S3, S4**
- **Hosts A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I**

---

## Self-Learning Multi-Switch Example

### Scenario
- **Suppose C sends frame to I, I responds to C**
- **Question: show switch tables and packet forwarding in S1, S2, S3, S4**

### Process
- **C → I: frame forwarded through switches**
- **I → C: response frame forwarded back**
- **Switch tables updated at each step**

- **In practice vendors sell combined switches plus routers**

---

## VLANS Spanning Multiple Switches

### Trunk Port

- **Frames forwarded within VLAN between switches can't be vanilla 802.1 frames (must carry VLAN ID info)**
- **802.1q protocol adds/removed additional header fields for frames forwarded between trunk ports**

### Network Layout
- **Electrical Engineering (VLAN ports 1-8)**
- **Computer Science (VLAN ports 9-15)**
- **Ports 2,3,5 belong to EE VLAN**
- **Ports 4,6,7,8 belong to CS VLAN**

---

## 802.1Q VLAN Frame Format

### Frame Structure
- **Type: 2-byte Tag Protocol Identifier (value: 81-00)**
- **Tag Control Information (12 bit VLAN ID field, 3 bit priority field like IP TOS)**
- **Recomputed CRC**

### Comparison
- **802.1 frame: dest. address, source address, data (payload), CRC, preamble, type**
- **802.1Q frame: dest. address, source address, preamble, data (payload), CRC, type**
