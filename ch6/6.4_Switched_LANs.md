# 6.4 Switched LANs

- Switched LANs use switches to connect multiple devices in a local network.
- **Ethernet:** Most common LAN technology.
- **Switches:** Forward frames based on MAC addresses.
- **VLANs:** Virtual LANs segment networks logically.

---

## Ethernet
- **Frame format:** Preamble, dest MAC, src MAC, type, data, CRC.
- **MAC address:** Unique 48-bit identifier.

---

## Switch Operation
- **Learning:** Builds MAC address table.
- **Forwarding:** Sends frames to correct port.

---

## VLANs
- **Segment network:** Isolate traffic, improve security.

## Summary Table
| Feature   | Ethernet | Switch | VLAN   |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Address   | MAC      | MAC    | Tag    |
| Function  | Frame Tx | Fwding | Segmt. |

## Practice Questions
1. **What is the function of a switch in a LAN?**
2. **How do VLANs improve security?**
3. **Draw a diagram of switch operation.**

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know Ethernet frame format and switch operation.
- Be able to draw and explain VLAN diagrams.

---

## MAC Addressing
- **Unicast:** Frame sent to a single MAC address.
- **Multicast:** Frame sent to a group of devices (special MAC addresses).
- **Broadcast:** Frame sent to all devices on the LAN (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).

## ARP Protocol and Security
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves IP to MAC addresses. Vulnerable to spoofing/poisoning attacks.

## Switching Techniques
- **Store-and-Forward:** Switch receives entire frame, checks for errors, then forwards.
- **Cut-Through:** Switch starts forwarding as soon as destination MAC is read (lower latency, but errors may propagate).

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- **Purpose:** Prevents loops in Ethernet networks with redundant links.
- **Operation:** Switches elect a root bridge and disable redundant paths to form a loop-free tree.
