# 6.5 Link Virtualization

- Link virtualization allows multiple logical links over a single physical link.
- **Techniques:** Tunneling, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching).

---

## Tunneling
- **Encapsulate packets:** Send through intermediate networks.
- **Use case:** VPNs.

---

## MPLS
- **Labels:** Forward packets based on labels, not IP.
- **Fast, flexible routing.**
