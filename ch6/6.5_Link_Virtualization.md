# 6.5 Link Virtualization

- Link virtualization allows multiple logical links over a single physical link.
- **Techniques:** Tunneling, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching).

---

## Tunneling
- **Encapsulate packets:** Send through intermediate networks.
- **Use case:** VPNs.

---

## MPLS
- **Labels:** Forward packets based on labels, not IP.
- **Fast, flexible routing.**

## Summary Table
| Technique | Use Case | Key Feature     |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Tunneling | VPN      | Encapsulation  |
| MPLS      | WAN      | Label switching|

## Practice Questions
1. **What is link virtualization?**
2. **How does MPLS differ from IP routing?**
3. **Draw a diagram of MPLS operation.**

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know tunneling and MPLS concepts.
- Be able to draw and explain MPLS diagrams.

## PPP and HDLC
- **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):** Used for direct connections between two nodes (e.g., dial-up, WAN links). Provides framing, error detection, and optional authentication.
- **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control):** Bit-oriented protocol for point-to-point and multipoint links. Provides framing, error detection, and flow control.
