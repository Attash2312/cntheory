# 6.8 Summary

- The link layer handles local data transfer, framing, error detection, and medium access.
- Key protocols: Ethernet, WiFi, PPP, ARP.
- Concepts: error detection/correction, multiple access, switching, data center topologies.
- **Network devices:** Hubs, switches, NICs with detailed operation and characteristics.
- **Switching types:** Layer 2, Layer 3, and multilayer switching with comparisons.
- **Hierarchical design:** Three-layer model (Access, Distribution, Core) for scalable networks.
- **Broadcast containment:** VLANs, subnetting, storm control to manage broadcast traffic.
