# 4.2 Inside a Router

- Routers forward packets between networks using routing tables and switching fabric.
- **Key components:** Input ports, output ports, switching fabric, routing processor.

---

## Router Components
- **Input port:** Receives packets, does lookup.
- **Switching fabric:** Connects input to output ports.
- **Output port:** Queues and transmits packets.
- **Routing processor:** Runs routing protocols, manages tables.
