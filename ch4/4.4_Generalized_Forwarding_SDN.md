# 4.4 Generalized Forwarding and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

- SDN separates the control plane (decision-making) from the data plane (forwarding).
- **Generalized forwarding:** Flexible, programmable packet handling.
- **OpenFlow:** Protocol for SDN switches/controllers.

---

## SDN Architecture
- **Controller:** Centralized control logic.
- **Switches:** Simple forwarding devices.
- **Southbound API:** (e.g., OpenFlow) connects controller to switches.

## SDN Use Cases and Benefits
- **Network Virtualization:** Easily create isolated virtual networks for tenants or applications.
- **Traffic Engineering:** Dynamically adjust paths for optimal performance.
- **Security:** Centralized control enables rapid response to threats and fine-grained policy enforcement.
- **Automation:** Simplifies network management and reduces human error.
