## Quick Revision Table
| Concept      | Key Point / Example         |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Routing      | Path selection, routers    |
| Forwarding   | Next-hop, switching fabric |
| IP           | Addressing, datagram       |
| IPv6         | 128-bit, improved features |
| SDN          | Control/data plane split   |
