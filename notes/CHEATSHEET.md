## OSI Model: 7 Layers (Mnemonic, Table, Analogy, Expanded)
**Mnemonic:** "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away" (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application)

| Layer | What Happens | Example Protocols | Analogy | Common Mistake |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| 7. Application | User apps use network | HTTP, SMTP | You write a letter | Confusing with Presentation |
| 6. Presentation | Translate, encrypt, compress | SSL, JPEG | Translator, zipper | Skipping this layer |
| 5. Session | Start/end conversations | NetBIOS, RPC | Phone call setup | Ignoring session management |
| 4. Transport | Reliable/fast delivery | TCP, UDP | Courier (with/without receipt) | Mixing up with Network |
| 3. Network | Routing, addressing | IP, OSPF | Postal service, GPS | Confusing with Data Link |
| 2. Data Link | Local delivery, error check | Ethernet, WiFi | Address on envelope | Mixing up with Physical |
| 1. Physical | Send bits/signals | Cables, WiFi | Wires, light, radio | Forgetting this is just signals |

## IP Addressing & Subnetting (Step-by-Step, Expanded)

2. Apply subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
3. Find network and host parts
4. Calculate range, broadcast, usable IPs
5. CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

**Mnemonic:** "Subnetting: Mask, Split, Range, Broadcast, Usable, CIDR"
