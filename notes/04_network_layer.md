# Network Layer (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is the Network Layer? (Expanded)
The network layer is responsible for moving packets between devices across different networks, handling logical addressing, routing, and fragmentation.

**Key Points:**
- Provides end-to-end delivery of packets across networks (internetworking).
- Handles logical addressing (IP addresses), routing, and fragmentation.
- Works with routers to find the best path for data.

**Real-World Example:**
- Your phone sends a WhatsApp message to a friend in another country—packets travel through many routers and networks.
- Visiting a website: Your request is routed through your ISP, backbone networks, and finally to the web server.

## Key Services (Expanded Table)
| Service | What it Does | Example | Layer |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Routing | Finds best path | GPS navigation | 3 |
| Addressing | Identifies devices | IP address | 3 |
| Fragmentation | Splits large packets | Mailing a big package in parts | 3 |
| Packet Forwarding | Moves packets to next hop | Routers | 3 |

**Mnemonic:** "RAPF: Routing, Addressing, Packet Forwarding, Fragmentation"

## Protocols at the Network Layer (Expanded)
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Logical addressing and routing
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Error messages (e.g., ping)
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Finds MAC for a given IP
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Shares one public IP among many devices
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Assigns IP addresses automatically

**Mnemonic:** "I Can Always Navigate Data" (ICMP, ARP, NAT, DHCP)

**Common Confusion:**
- ARP is not a routing protocol; it resolves addresses within a LAN.
- NAT is not a security feature, but it hides internal IPs.

## Routing Algorithms (With ASCII Diagrams & Expanded)
- **Dijkstra (Link-State):** Finds shortest path (like Google Maps)
- **Bellman-Ford (Distance-Vector):** Each router tells neighbors its best-known distance
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Simple, uses hop count
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Advanced, uses link-state
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Connects different ISPs (the Internet backbone)

**Mermaid Diagram: Shortest Path Example**
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[A] -- 1 --> B[B]
  B -- 1 --> C[C]
  A -- 2 --> D[D]
  D -- 1 --> E[E]
  B -- 1 --> E
```
- Dijkstra finds A→C as A-B-C (cost 2)

**Edge Case:**
- RIP is limited to 15 hops; OSPF scales better for large networks.

## Subnetting (Step-by-Step & Expanded)
1. Write IP in binary (e.g., 192.168.1.10 → 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010)
2. Apply subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
3. Find network and host parts
4. Calculate range, broadcast, usable IPs
5. CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

**Mnemonic:** "Subnetting: Mask, Split, Range, Broadcast, Usable, CIDR"

**Common Confusion:**
- Subnet mask vs. default gateway: Mask divides network, gateway routes traffic.

## Real-World Example: Home WiFi with NAT (Expanded)
- Your home router uses NAT to let all your devices share one public IP.
- When you visit a website, NAT keeps track of which device made which request.
- DHCP assigns IPs to your devices automatically.

## Troubleshooting Network Layer (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| No internet | IP address, router, ping |
| Can’t reach site | Routing, traceroute |
| Slow network | Congestion, route changes |
| IP conflict | DHCP, static IPs |
