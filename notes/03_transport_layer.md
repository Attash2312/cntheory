# Transport Layer (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is the Transport Layer? (Expanded)
The transport layer is responsible for moving data between applications on different devices, ensuring reliability, order, and efficiency as needed.

**Key Points:**
- Provides end-to-end communication between processes.
- Handles segmentation, reassembly, error detection, and flow/congestion control.

**Real-World Example:**
- Downloading a file (TCP ensures all parts arrive in order).
- Watching a live stream (UDP sends data quickly, even if some is lost).

---

## Services Provided (Expanded Table)
| Service | TCP | UDP | SCTP |
|---------|-----|-----|------|
| Reliable? | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Ordered? | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Fast? | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Connection? | Yes | No | Yes |
| Use Case | Web, Email | Video, Games | Telephony |

**Mnemonic:** "TCP = Telephone Call (reliable), UDP = Postcard (fast)"

---

## Multiplexing & Demultiplexing (Expanded)
- **Multiplexing:** Combining data from many apps to send over the network.
- **Demultiplexing:** Delivering data to the right app using port numbers.

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[App1]--\
[App2]---[Transport Layer]---[Network]
[App3]--/
```

**Common Confusion:**
- Port numbers identify applications, not devices.

---

## Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) (Expanded)
- **Stop-and-Wait:** Send one packet, wait for ACK.
- **Go-Back-N:** Send N packets, resend from error.
- **Selective Repeat:** Only resend lost packets.

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Sender] --pkt1--> [Receiver]
         <--ACK1--
[Sender] --pkt2--> [Receiver]
         <--ACK2--
```

**Edge Case:**
- Selective Repeat is more efficient but complex.

---

## TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (Expanded)
- **Connection-oriented:** 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- **Reliable, ordered delivery**
- **Flow & Congestion Control**
- **Sliding Window:** Controls how much data is sent before waiting for ACKs.
- **Timeouts & Retransmissions:** Handle lost packets.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. SYN: Client → Server ("Can we talk?")
2. SYN-ACK: Server → Client ("Yes, can you?")
3. ACK: Client → Server ("Yes!")

**ASCII Flowchart:**
```
[Client] --SYN--> [Server]
         <--SYN-ACK--
[Client] --ACK--> [Server]
```

**Common Confusion:**
- TCP is not always slower; it can be tuned for speed.

---

## UDP: User Datagram Protocol (Expanded)
- **Connectionless, fast, unreliable**
- **Used for:** Video, games, VoIP
- **No flow or congestion control**

**Mnemonic:** "UDP = Unreliable, Dashing, Postcard"

---

## Flow & Congestion Control (Expanded Table)
| Feature | What it Does | TCP | UDP |
|---------|--------------|-----|-----|
| Flow Control | Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver | ✅ | ❌ |
| Congestion Control | Prevents network overload | ✅ | ❌ |
| Sliding Window | Controls data in flight | ✅ | ❌ |

**Edge Case:**
- TCP Vegas, Reno, CUBIC are different congestion control algorithms.

---

## Troubleshooting Transport Layer (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| Slow download | TCP window size, congestion |
| Packet loss | UDP, network errors |
| Connection drops | Handshake, firewall |
| Out-of-order packets | Sliding window, reassembly |

## If You See This in the Exam… (Pro Tips)
- **“Compare TCP and UDP”**: Mention reliability, order, speed, use cases
- **“Draw handshake”**: Use ASCII flowchart
- **“Troubleshoot”**: Check window size, ACKs, congestion
- **“Explain RDT types”**: Know Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat

---

## Memory Aids & Mnemonics (Expanded)
- TCP: "Telephone Call Protocol"
- UDP: "Unreliable Datagram Postcard"
- 3-way handshake: "SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK = Can we talk? Yes, can you? Yes!"
- RDT: "Stop, Go, Select!" (Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat)
