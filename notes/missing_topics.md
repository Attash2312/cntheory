# Missing Topics (Expanded, Exam-Focused)

---

## DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol)
- **What is it?** Multicast routing protocol using distance-vector info to build multicast trees
- **How it works:** Routers share info, prune branches with no group members
- **Analogy:** Like a delivery truck only visiting houses that want a package

---

## PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)
- **What is it?** Builds multicast trees using info from other routing protocols
- **Use:** Efficient group communication (e.g., live video streaming)

---

## ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
- **What is it?** Routers mark packets instead of dropping them to signal congestion
- **Benefit:** Helps avoid packet loss and improves congestion control

---

## RED (Random Early Detection)
- **What is it?** Queuing method that drops packets early to prevent congestion
- **Analogy:** Like closing the door early at a club to avoid overcrowding

---

## TCP SACK (Selective Acknowledgment)
- **What is it?** TCP feature that allows the receiver to inform the sender about all segments that have arrived successfully, so only missing segments are resent
- **Benefit:** More efficient retransmission

---

## Delay-Based TCP
- **What is it?** TCP variant that uses delay (not just loss) as a signal for congestion
- **Benefit:** Can react to congestion before packet loss occurs

---

## QUIC
- **What is it?** Modern transport protocol by Google, combines reliability and speed, used by HTTP/3
- **Features:** Built-in encryption, faster connection setup, multiplexing

---

## RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding)
- **What is it?** Multicast routing technique that ensures packets follow the shortest path from the source
- **Analogy:** Like only accepting a package if it arrives by the shortest route from the sender

---

## Silly Window Syndrome
- **What is it?** TCP problem where data is sent in very small segments, wasting bandwidth
- **Prevention:** Use algorithms (like Nagle’s) to avoid sending tiny packets
- **Analogy:** Like mailing one word at a time instead of a whole letter

---

## Nagle’s Algorithm
- **What is it?** TCP algorithm that combines small outgoing messages and sends them all at once to avoid Silly Window Syndrome
- **Analogy:** Like waiting to fill a box before mailing it, instead of sending each item separately

---

## SYN Flooding Attack
- **What is it?** Attack that overwhelms a server with fake connection requests
- **Prevention:** Firewalls, SYN cookies

---

## BitTorrent (P2P Application)
- **How it works:** Files are split into pieces and shared among many users (peers). Each peer downloads and uploads pieces to others
- **Advantage:** Fast, efficient downloads, even for large files
- **Analogy:** Like a group of people each bringing a piece of a puzzle to complete the whole picture

---

## Real-World Example: BitTorrent Download
1. You start downloading a large file
2. Your client connects to many peers
3. Each peer shares pieces of the file
4. You upload pieces you have to others
5. Download completes faster than from a single server

## Troubleshooting Advanced/Multicast/Congestion Issues
- **Multicast Not Working:** Check DVMRP/PIM config, group membership
- **Congestion:** Check RED/ECN settings, queue lengths
- **TCP Inefficiency:** Check SACK, Nagle, window size
- **DoS Attack:** Check SYN cookies, firewall, IDS

---

## More Real-World Scenarios
- **Live Event Streaming:** Uses PIM, DVMRP, RPF
- **Cloud File Sync:** Uses BitTorrent, QUIC
- **Enterprise Network:** Uses ECN, RED, SACK

6. Not understanding SYN flooding defense
7. Forgetting BitTorrent’s P2P logic
8. Not knowing troubleshooting steps
9. Overlooking real-world advanced flows
10. Skipping Q&A practice

## Step-by-Step: How DVMRP Builds Multicast Trees
1. Routers exchange distance-vector info with neighbors.
2. Each router builds a shortest-path tree to the source.
3. Routers prune branches with no group members.
4. Only routers with group members forward multicast packets.

**Diagram:** [Source] -> [Router1] -> [Router2] (pruned if no members)

---

## Step-by-Step: How PIM Builds Multicast Trees
1. Routers use info from other routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
2. Build shared or source-specific trees for multicast groups.
3. Forward packets only along tree branches with group members.

---

## Step-by-Step: How ECN and RED Work
- **RED:**
  1. Router monitors queue length.
  2. If queue grows, randomly drops/marks packets before full.
- **ECN:**
  1. Instead of dropping, router marks packets with ECN bit.
  2. Receiver notifies sender, sender slows down.

---

## Step-by-Step: How TCP SACK and QUIC Work
- **TCP SACK:**
  1. Receiver tells sender exactly which segments arrived.
  2. Sender only retransmits missing segments.
- **QUIC:**
  1. Client and server negotiate connection (faster than TCP handshake).
  2. Built-in encryption, multiplexing, and loss recovery.

---

## Step-by-Step: How SYN Flooding and BitTorrent Attacks Work and Are Mitigated
- **SYN Flooding:**
  1. Attacker sends many SYN requests, never completes handshake.
  2. Server’s resources are tied up, can’t serve real users.
  3. Mitigation: SYN cookies, firewalls, rate limiting.
- **BitTorrent Attack:**
  1. Attacker floods tracker or peers with fake requests.
  2. Mitigation: Peer verification, blacklisting, tracker security.
