# Missing & Advanced Topics (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What are Advanced & Missing Topics? (Expanded)
These are important concepts and protocols that go beyond the basics, often appearing in exams or real-world scenarios. Mastering them gives you an edge!

**Key Points:**
- Multicast, advanced congestion control, TCP enhancements, modern protocols, and P2P are crucial for modern networks.
- Understanding attacks and edge cases helps in troubleshooting and design.

## Multicast Routing (DVMRP, PIM, RPF) (Expanded)
- **Multicast:** Send data to many receivers efficiently (e.g., live video to many viewers)
- **DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol):** Builds multicast trees using distance vectors
- **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast):** Works with any unicast routing
- **RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding):** Prevents loops in multicast
- **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Manages group membership

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Source]--[Router1]--[Router2]--[Receivers]
```

**Mnemonic:** "DVMRP = Distance Vector, PIM = Protocol Independent, RPF = Reverse Path, IGMP = Group Management"

**Common Confusion:**
- Multicast is not broadcast; only interested receivers get the data.

---

## Congestion Control Enhancements (ECN, RED, SACK) (Expanded)
- **ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification):** Marks packets instead of dropping
- **RED (Random Early Detection):** Drops/marks packets before queue is full
- **SACK (Selective Acknowledgment):** TCP can acknowledge non-contiguous data
- **FEC (Forward Error Correction):** Adds redundancy to recover lost data

**Comparison Table: ECN vs RED vs SACK vs FEC**
| Feature | ECN | RED | SACK | FEC |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| What it does | Marks congestion | Early drop/mark | Acks missing data | Recovers lost data |
| Layer | Network | Network | Transport | Transport |

**Mnemonic:** "Every Red Sack Fights Congestion"

**Edge Case:**
- SACK is especially useful for high-loss or high-latency networks.

---

## TCP Enhancements & Attacks (Expanded)
- **Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm:** Reduces small packets (waits to send)
- **Silly Window Syndrome:** Inefficient small window sizes
- **SACK:** Acknowledge out-of-order segments
- **SYN Flood:** Attack that overwhelms server with SYNs
- **Window Scaling:** Allows large TCP windows for high-speed networks
- **TCP Fast Open:** Reduces handshake delay

**Mnemonic:** "Nagle = No Nagging Small Packets"

**Common Confusion:**
- Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm can increase latency for interactive apps.

---

## Modern Protocols: QUIC (Expanded)
- **QUIC:** Google‚Äôs protocol, faster than TCP+TLS, used by YouTube, Google
- Combines transport and security, reduces latency
- Uses UDP as its base, supports multiplexing and connection migration

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Client]--QUIC-->[Server]
```

**Edge Case:**
- QUIC can recover from IP address changes without breaking the connection.

---

## BitTorrent & P2P (Expanded)
- **BitTorrent:** Splits files into pieces, downloads from many peers
- **P2P (Peer-to-Peer):** No central server, direct sharing
- **Tracker:** Coordinates peers in BitTorrent
- **Seeder/Leecher:** Seeder has full file, leecher is downloading

**Real-World Example:**
- Downloading Ubuntu Linux via BitTorrent
- Sharing large datasets in research

**Common Confusion:**
- P2P is not always legal; depends on content shared.

## Troubleshooting Advanced Topics (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| Multicast not working | DVMRP, PIM, IGMP config |
| Congestion | ECN, RED, SACK, FEC settings |
| Slow downloads | BitTorrent peers, SACK, window scaling |
| SYN flood | Firewall, rate limiting |
