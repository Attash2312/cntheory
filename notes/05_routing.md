# Routing (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is Routing? (Expanded)
Routing is the process of finding the best path for data to travel across networks. Routers use algorithms and tables to decide where to send each packet.

**Key Points:**
- Routing can be static (manual) or dynamic (automatic updates).
- Routers use metrics like hop count, cost, and bandwidth to choose paths.

**Real-World Example:**
- Sending an email from India to the US‚Äîdata hops through many routers and networks.
- Streaming a video from Netflix‚Äîpackets may take different routes to reach you.

## Types of Routing (Expanded Table)
| Type | What it Does | Example | Pros | Cons |
|------|--------------|---------|------|------|
| Static | Fixed path, manual | Small office | Simple, predictable | Not scalable |
| Dynamic | Routers update paths | The Internet | Scalable, adapts | Complex, needs protocols |

**Mnemonic:** "Static = Set, Dynamic = Decides"

## Routing Algorithms (With ASCII Diagrams & Expanded)
- **Dijkstra (Link-State):** Each router knows the whole network, computes shortest path.
- **Bellman-Ford (Distance-Vector):** Routers only know neighbors, share best-known distances.
- **RIP:** Simple, uses hop count, max 15 hops.
- **OSPF:** Advanced, uses link-state, supports large networks.
- **BGP:** Connects ISPs, global Internet, uses path vector.

**ASCII Diagram: Routing Example**
```
[A]---1---[B]---1---[C]
 |         |
 2         1
 |         |
[D]-------[E]
```
- Dijkstra finds A‚ÜíC as A-B-C (cost 2)

**Edge Case:**
- RIP is vulnerable to count-to-infinity problem.
- BGP is policy-based, not just shortest path.

---

## Intra-AS vs Inter-AS Routing (Expanded)
- **Intra-AS (within one network):** OSPF, RIP
- **Inter-AS (between networks):** BGP

**Mnemonic:** "Intra = Inside, Inter = Between"

**Common Confusion:**
- OSPF and RIP are not used between ISPs; BGP is.

---

## Real-World Example: ISP Routing (Expanded)
- Your ISP uses OSPF for its own network, BGP to connect to other ISPs.
- Large companies may use both OSPF (internal) and BGP (external).

## Troubleshooting Routing (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| Can‚Äôt reach site | Routing table, traceroute |
| Slow path | Congestion, route changes |
| Loops | Routing algorithm, config |
| Route flapping | BGP stability, link issues |
