# Link Layer (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is the Link Layer? (Expanded)
The link layer is responsible for local delivery of data frames between devices on the same network segment. It handles framing, addressing, error detection, and access to the physical medium.

**Key Points:**
- Works with MAC addresses for local delivery.
- Handles error detection and sometimes correction.
- Manages access to shared media (Ethernet, WiFi).

**Real-World Example:**
- Your laptop sends a file to a printer over WiFi or Ethernet.
- Office switch forwards frames only to the intended device.

## Key Services (Expanded Table)
| Service | What it Does | Example | Layer |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Framing | Packages data | Envelope | 2 |
| Error Detection | Finds mistakes | Parity, CRC | 2 |
| Local Delivery | Sends to right device | MAC address | 2 |
| Media Access | Controls who can send | CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA | 2 |

**Mnemonic:** "FELM: Framing, Error, Local, Media"

---

## Protocols at the Link Layer (Expanded)
- **Ethernet:** Wired LAN, uses CSMA/CD
- **WiFi (802.11):** Wireless LAN, uses CSMA/CA
- **PPP:** Point-to-Point Protocol (used in direct connections)
- **VLAN:** Virtual LANs for segmentation

**Mnemonic:** "Every WiFi Provides Packets and VLANs"

**Common Confusion:**
- Ethernet and WiFi both use frames, but handle collisions differently.

---

## Devices at the Link Layer (Expanded)
- **Switch:** Forwards frames to correct device
- **NIC (Network Interface Card):** Hardware for network connection
- **Bridge:** Connects LAN segments

---

## Error Detection (With ASCII Diagrams & Expanded)
- **Parity Bit:** Adds a bit to make total 1s even/odd
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** Math to detect errors
- **Checksum:** Simple sum for error detection

**ASCII Diagram: Parity Example**
```
Data: 1011
Even Parity: 10111 (total 1s = 4)
```

**Edge Case:**
- CRC can detect burst errors, not just single-bit errors.

---

## Multiple Access Protocols (Expanded)
- **CSMA/CD (Ethernet):** Detects collisions, resends
- **CSMA/CA (WiFi):** Avoids collisions
- **Token Ring:** Uses a token to control access

**Comparison Table: CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA vs Token Ring**
| Feature | CSMA/CD | CSMA/CA | Token Ring |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| Detects or Avoids? | Detects | Avoids | Avoids |
| Used in | Ethernet | WiFi | Token Ring LAN |
| Collision Handling | Resend | Wait | Token passing |

**Common Confusion:**
- Token Ring is rare today but important historically.

---

## VLANs (Virtual LANs) (Expanded)
- Create separate logical networks on same hardware
- Example: Office with HR and IT on different VLANs
- VLANs improve security and reduce broadcast traffic

---

## Troubleshooting Link Layer (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| No connection | Cable, WiFi, NIC |
| Errors | Parity, CRC, switch |
| Wrong device | MAC address, VLAN |
| Collisions | CSMA/CD, network load |
