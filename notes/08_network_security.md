# Network Security (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is Network Security? (Expanded)
Network security protects data as it travels, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). It uses cryptography, authentication, secure protocols, and network devices to defend against threats.

**Key Points:**
- Protects data in transit and at rest
- Prevents unauthorized access, tampering, and denial of service
- Uses multiple layers of defense (defense in depth)

**Real-World Example:**
- Online banking uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to keep your info safe
- VPNs encrypt your internet traffic on public WiFi

## Security Principles (Expanded Table)
| Principle | What it Means | Example | Layer |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Confidentiality | Only intended can read | Encryption | All |
| Integrity | No tampering | Hashes, digital signatures | All |
| Availability | Always accessible | Redundancy, backups | All |
| Authentication | Prove identity | Passwords, biometrics | All |
| Authorization | Control access | Permissions, firewalls | All |

**Mnemonic:** "CIAAA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization"

**Common Confusion:**
- Authentication = Who are you? Authorization = What can you do?

---

## Cryptography (With ASCII Diagrams & Expanded)
- **Symmetric:** Same key for encrypt/decrypt (e.g., AES)
- **Asymmetric:** Public/private keys (e.g., RSA)
- **Hashing:** One-way function for integrity (e.g., SHA-256)

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Message]--(Encrypt w/Key)-->[Ciphertext]--(Decrypt w/Key)-->[Message]
```

**Edge Case:**
- Asymmetric is slower but more secure for key exchange.

---

## Authentication (Step-by-Step & Expanded)
1. User provides credentials (password, fingerprint)
2. System checks credentials
3. Access granted if match
4. May use multi-factor (MFA) for extra security

**Mnemonic:** "Authentication = Are you who you say you are?"

**Common Confusion:**
- Passwords are not the only authentication method; biometrics, tokens, and certificates are used too.

---

## Secure Protocols (SSL/TLS, IPsec, SSH, HTTPS) (Expanded)
- **SSL/TLS:** Encrypts web traffic (HTTPS)
- **IPsec:** Encrypts at network layer (VPNs)
- **SSH:** Secure remote login
- **HTTPS:** Secure web browsing (uses SSL/TLS)

**Comparison Table: SSL/TLS vs IPsec vs SSH**
| Feature | SSL/TLS | IPsec | SSH |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| Layer | Application | Network | Application |
| Use Case | Web (HTTPS) | VPN | Remote login |
| Key Exchange | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Common Confusion:**
- SSL is deprecated; TLS is the modern standard.

---

## Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) (Expanded)
- **Firewall:** Blocks unwanted traffic, enforces security policy
- **IDS:** Detects suspicious activity, alerts admin
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** Blocks attacks in real time

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Internet]--[Firewall]--[Your Network]
```

**Edge Case:**
- Firewalls can be hardware or software, stateful or stateless.

---

## Real-World Example: Email Security (Expanded)
- Email uses digital signatures for integrity, encryption for confidentiality
- Spam filters and DMARC prevent phishing

---

## Troubleshooting Security (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| Can‚Äôt access site | Firewall, SSL cert |
| Data leak | Encryption, access control |
| Tampered data | Hashes, integrity checks |
| Phishing | Email filters, user training |
