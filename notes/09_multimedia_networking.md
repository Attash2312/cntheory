# Multimedia Networking (Maximally Detailed Edition)

## What is Multimedia Networking? (Expanded)
Multimedia networking delivers audio, video, and voice over networks. It requires special protocols and techniques to handle delay, jitter, and loss.

**Key Points:**
- Supports streaming (live and stored), VoIP, and video conferencing
- Needs to manage quality of service (QoS)
- Uses protocols like RTP, RTSP, SIP

**Real-World Example:**
- YouTube uses CDNs to stream video smoothly to millions
- Zoom uses RTP and SIP for real-time video calls

---

## Applications (Expanded Table)
| App | What it Does | Example | Protocols |
|-----|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Streaming | Plays audio/video | Netflix, YouTube | RTP, RTSP |
| VoIP | Voice calls | Skype, WhatsApp | SIP, RTP |
| Live | Real-time events | Twitch, Zoom | RTP, SIP |

**Mnemonic:** "Streaming = Stored or Live, VoIP = Voice over IP"

---

## Protocols (With ASCII Diagrams & Expanded)
- **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** Delivers audio/video
- **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol):** Controls streaming
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):** Sets up calls
- **H.264, H.265:** Video compression standards

**ASCII Diagram:**
```
[Client]--RTP-->[Server]
[Client]<--RTSP--[Server]
```

**Common Confusion:**
- RTP does not guarantee delivery; it is often used with UDP.

---

## Streaming: Stored vs Live (Step-by-Step & Expanded)
- **Stored:** Video is pre-recorded (Netflix)
- **Live:** Video is sent as it happens (Twitch)
- **Buffering:** Used to smooth out network delays

**Comparison Table: Stored vs Live Streaming (Expanded)**
| Feature | Stored | Live |
|---------|--------|------|
| Buffering | Yes | Minimal |
| Delay | Low | Can be high |
| Example | Netflix | Twitch |
| Protocols | RTP, RTSP | RTP, SIP |

**Edge Case:**
- Live streaming is more sensitive to delay and loss.

---

## QoS (Quality of Service) (Expanded)
- **Delay:** Time for data to arrive
- **Jitter:** Variation in delay
- **Loss:** Packets not arriving
- **Bandwidth:** Amount of data that can be sent
- **Reservation:** Some networks reserve bandwidth for media

**Mnemonic:** "DJ Loves Quality" (Delay, Jitter, Loss, QoS)

**Common Confusion:**
- QoS is not just about speed; it’s about consistency and reliability.

---

## Real-World Example: Video Call on Zoom (Expanded)
- Audio/video sent in real time using RTP
- SIP sets up the call
- RTSP may control the stream
- Buffering helps smooth out network hiccups

## Troubleshooting Multimedia (Quick Win Table)
| Problem | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|
| Buffering | Bandwidth, server |
| Poor quality | Delay, jitter, loss |
| Call drops | SIP, network |
| Out-of-sync audio/video | Jitter, buffering |
