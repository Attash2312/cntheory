# 9.7 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: Jitter Calculation
**Question:**
A VoIP packet arrives 30 ms later than expected. If the playout buffer is 50 ms, will the packet be played out on time?
**Solution:**
- Yes, because 30 ms < 50 ms buffer.

## Example 2: Protocol Identification
**Question:**
Which protocol is used for media transport in real-time applications?
**Solution:**
- RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).

## Example 3: Buffering Scenario
**Question:**
Why is buffering important in streaming video?
**Solution:**
- Handles network jitter and delay, prevents playback interruptions.

## Example 4: Scheduling Mechanisms
**Question:**
Compare FIFO and priority queuing for multimedia traffic.
**Solution:**
- FIFO: No priority, simple.
- Priority: Real-time traffic gets faster service.

## Example 5: Token Bucket Policing
**Question:**
How does the token bucket mechanism allow bursty traffic?
**Solution:**
- Tokens accumulate, allowing bursts up to bucket size.

## Example 6: RTP Sequence Numbers
**Question:**
What is the purpose of sequence numbers in RTP packets?
**Solution:**
- Allow receiver to detect loss and reorder packets for correct playback.
