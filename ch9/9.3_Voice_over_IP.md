# 9.3 Voice over IP (VoIP)

- VoIP: Transmitting voice calls over IP networks (Internet).
- Examples: Skype, WhatsApp calls.

---

## Architecture
- **Digitization:** Analog voice converted to digital.
- **Packetization:** Voice split into packets.
- **Transport:** Sent over IP using RTP/UDP.

---

## Delay and Loss
- **End-to-end delay:** Should be <150 ms for good quality.
- **Packet loss:** Some loss tolerable, but affects quality.
- **Jitter:** Handled by playout buffer.

---

## Protocols
- **RTP:** Transports voice data.
- **SIP/H.323:** Call setup and management.

## Practice Questions
1. **What is the acceptable end-to-end delay for VoIP?**
2. **How does jitter affect VoIP?**
3. **Which protocols are used for VoIP?**

## Summary Table
| Issue      | Solution         |
|------------|-----------------|
| Delay      | Playout buffer   |
| Loss       | FEC, retransmit  |
| Jitter     | Buffering        |

**Exam Tips:**
- Know VoIP architecture and delay/loss solutions.
- Be able to draw VoIP call diagrams.

## VoIP Protocol Stack
- **Application:** SIP, H.323 (call setup).
- **Transport:** RTP/UDP (media transport).
- **Network:** IP.

## Common Codecs
- **G.711:** Uncompressed, high quality, high bandwidth.
- **G.729:** Compressed, lower bandwidth, good quality.
- **Opus:** Modern, flexible, high quality at low bit rates.

## Error Recovery in VoIP
- **FEC:** Adds redundancy to recover from lost packets.
- **Interleaving:** Spreads audio data across packets.
- **Retransmission:** Limited use due to real-time constraints.
