# 9.2 Streaming Stored Video

- Streaming stored video: playing video as it downloads, not waiting for full download.
- Examples: YouTube, Netflix.

---

## Architecture
- **Client-server:** Server streams video to client.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Distributes video across multiple servers for scalability and reliability.

---

## Protocols
- **HTTP streaming:** Uses standard web servers and HTTP.
- **RTP/UDP streaming:** For lower latency, but less reliable.

---

## Buffering
- **Client buffers data to handle network jitter and delay.**
- **Startup delay:** Time to fill buffer before playback.

## Practice Questions
1. **What is the purpose of buffering in video streaming?**
2. **How does a CDN improve video streaming?**

## Summary Table
| Protocol | Use Case         | Reliability |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| HTTP     | Most streaming   | High        |
| RTP/UDP  | Low-latency apps | Medium      |

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know how buffering and CDNs work.
- Be able to draw CDN diagrams.

---

## Adaptive Streaming
- **DASH:** Client requests video chunks at different qualities based on bandwidth.
- **HLS:** Similar approach, widely used on Apple devices.

## Buffering Strategies
- **Playout Buffer:** Smooths out jitter and delay.
- **Dynamic Buffering:** Adjusts buffer size based on network conditions.

## Error Recovery
- **FEC (Forward Error Correction):** Adds redundant data to recover from loss.
- **Retransmission:** Resend lost packets (limited use in real-time).
- **Interleaving:** Spreads data across packets to minimize impact of loss.
