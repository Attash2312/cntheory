# 2.8 Summary

- Network applications use client-server or P2P architectures.
- Key protocols: HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DNS, FTP.
- Concepts: sockets, streaming, CDN, DNS, email, P2P.
- **Client-server roles:** Clear separation of client and server functions.
- **P2P networks:** Decentralized architecture with distributed resources.
- **Multiple roles:** Single computers can serve multiple functions.

## Chapter 2: Application Layer - Complete Coverage

### Application Layer Overview
- **Conceptual and implementation aspects** of application-layer protocols
- **Transport-layer service models** and their requirements
- **Client-server paradigm** and its characteristics
- **Peer-to-peer paradigm** and its advantages
- **Popular applications:** Social networking, Web, email, streaming, games, VoIP
- **Programming network applications** using socket API

### Creating Network Applications
- **Write programs that run on different end systems**
- **Communicate over network** (e.g., web server â†” browser)
- **No need to write software for network-core devices**
- **Applications on end systems allows for rapid app development**

### Processes Communicating
- **Process:** Program running within a host
- **Client process:** Initiates communication
- **Server process:** Waits to be contacted
- **P2P applications:** Have both client and server processes

### Transport Service Requirements
- **Data integrity:** Some apps require 100% reliable transfer, others tolerate loss
- **Timing:** Real-time apps need low delay, others can tolerate higher delays
- **Throughput:** Multimedia apps need minimum throughput, elastic apps use whatever available
- **Security:** Encryption, data integrity, authentication

### Internet Transport Protocols
- **TCP Service:** Reliable transport, flow control, congestion control, connection-oriented
- **UDP Service:** Unreliable data transfer, no guarantees
- **TLS:** Provides encrypted TCP connections, data integrity, end-point authentication

### Web and HTTP
- **Web page structure:** Objects addressable by URLs
- **HTTP:** Stateless protocol using TCP
- **Non-persistent vs Persistent:** Connection management strategies
- **HTTP messages:** Request/response format with headers and body
- **Cookies:** Maintain user/server state, privacy implications
- **Web caching:** Proxy servers, conditional GET, performance benefits

### Electronic Mail
- **Three components:** User agents, mail servers, SMTP
- **SMTP:** TCP-based, command/response, 7-bit ASCII
- **Mail access protocols:** POP3 (download/delete), IMAP (server-side management)
- **POP3 phases:** Authorization, transaction
- **IMAP features:** Folder management, state across sessions

### DNS: Internet Directory Service
- **Services:** Hostname to IP translation, aliasing, load distribution
- **Why distributed:** Avoid single point of failure, traffic volume, maintenance
- **Hierarchy:** Root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers, local DNS
- **Root servers:** 13 worldwide, geographic distribution, anycast routing
- **Resolution process:** Iterative queries through hierarchy

### P2P Applications
- **Pure P2P:** No always-on server, peers directly communicate
- **File distribution:** Client-server vs P2P performance comparison
- **BitTorrent:** Chunk-based distribution, tit-for-tat, rarest first
- **DHTs:** Distributed hash tables, circular DHT with shortcuts
- **Node management:** Arrival/departure handling

### Video Streaming and CDNs
- **DASH:** Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP
- **Client intelligence:** Bandwidth measurement, chunk selection, encoding rate adaptation
- **CDN challenges:** Single server limitations (failure, congestion, distance)
- **CDN strategies:** Enter deep (Akamai), bring home (Limelight)
- **Content access:** DNS-based redirection, HTTP delivery

### Socket Programming
- **Socket API:** BSD4.1 UNIX introduction, client/server paradigm
- **UDP sockets:** No connection, unreliable datagrams, explicit addressing
- **TCP sockets:** Connection-oriented, reliable byte stream, multiple clients
- **Programming models:** Handshake processes for both protocols
