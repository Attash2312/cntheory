## Common Exam Mistakes
- Confusing client-server and P2P architectures.
- Forgetting protocol ports (e.g., HTTP 80, SMTP 25).
- Not distinguishing between POP3 and IMAP.
- Overlooking DNS caching and record types.
- Not practicing socket programming code.

**Exam Tips:**
- Focus on protocol roles, architectures, and code examples.
- Practice drawing diagrams and writing code snippets.
- Avoid common mistakes listed above.
