# 2.3 Electronic Mail

- Email allows users to send and receive messages over the Internet.
- **Protocols:** SMTP (sending), POP3/IMAP (retrieving).

---

## Email Protocols
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Pushes mail from client to server and between servers.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Downloads mail to client, usually deletes from server.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Synchronizes mail across devices, keeps mail on server.
- **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):** Allows email to include multimedia (images, audio, attachments).

## Practice Questions
1. **Which protocol is used to send email?**
2. **Compare POP3 and IMAP.**
3. **Draw a diagram of email delivery.**
4. **What is MIME and why is it important?**
5. **List the ports for SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.**

---

**Exam Tips:**
- Know protocol roles, ports, and differences.
- Be able to draw and explain email flow diagrams.
- Understand MIME for multimedia email.

## Email Security
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Prevents sender address forgery by specifying allowed sending servers for a domain.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Adds a digital signature to emails, allowing recipients to verify authenticity.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):** Builds on SPF and DKIM, provides policy and reporting for email authentication.
- **Email Encryption:**
  - **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):** End-to-end encryption for email content.
  - **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):** Uses certificates for email encryption and signing.
