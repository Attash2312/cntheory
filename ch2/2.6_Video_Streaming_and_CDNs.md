# 2.6 Video Streaming and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)

- Video streaming: Playing video as it downloads.
- **Types:** Live streaming, on-demand (stored) streaming.
- **CDN:** Distributes content across multiple servers for scalability and reliability.

---

## Video Streaming and Content Distribution Networks

### Video Streaming: DASH

#### DASH: Dynamic, Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
- **Server:**
  - Divides video file into multiple chunks
  - Each chunk stored, encoded at different rates
  - Manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
- **Client:**
  - Periodically measures server-to-client bandwidth
  - Consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
  - Chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
  - Can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time)

#### DASH: Client Intelligence
- **Client determines:**
  - When to request chunk (so that buffer starvation, or overflow, does not occur)
  - What encoding rate to request (higher quality when more bandwidth available)
  - Where to request chunk (can request from URL server that is "close" to client or has high available bandwidth)

#### DASH: Client-Server Interaction
- **Client requests manifest file**
- **Client requests chunk 1 at rate 1**
- **Client requests chunk 2 at rate 2**
- **Client requests chunk 3 at rate 1**
- **Client requests chunk 4 at rate 3**
- **Client requests chunk 5 at rate 2**

### Content Distribution Networks

#### CDN: Content Distribution Networks
- **Challenge:** How to stream content (selected from millions of videos) to hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users?
- **Option 1:** Single, large "mega-server"
  - Single point of failure
  - Point of network congestion
  - Long path to distant clients
  - Multiple copies of video sent over outgoing link
- **Option 2:** Store/serve multiple copies of videos at multiple geographically distributed sites (CDN)

#### CDN: Store/Forward Multiple Copies in Multiple Geographic Sites
- **Enter deep:** Push CDN servers deep into many access networks
  - Close to users
  - Used by Akamai, 1700 locations
- **Bring home:** Smaller number (10's) of larger clusters in POPs near (but not within) access networks
  - Used by Limelight

#### CDN: Simple Operation
- **User requests video from netcinema.com**
- **Directed by netcinema.com to a CDN server**

## Streaming Types
- **Live streaming:** Real-time broadcast (Twitch, sports).
- **On-demand:** Pre-recorded (YouTube, Netflix).
- **Adaptive streaming:** Adjusts video quality based on network conditions (e.g., DASH, HLS).

---

## CDN Operation
- **Edge servers:** Store copies of content closer to users.
- **Load balancing:** Distributes requests among servers.
- **Redundancy:** Multiple servers ensure reliability.

---

## Buffering
- Handles network jitter and delay.
- Startup delay: Time to fill buffer before playback.
