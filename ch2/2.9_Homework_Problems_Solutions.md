# 2.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: HTTP Methods
**Question:**
List three HTTP methods and their uses.
**Solution:**
- GET: Retrieve resource
- POST: Submit data
- DELETE: Remove resource

---

## Example 2: Email Protocols
**Question:**
Compare POP3 and IMAP.
**Solution:**
- POP3: Downloads and deletes mail from server
- IMAP: Synchronizes and keeps mail on server

---

## Example 3: DNS Resolution
**Question:**
Explain the DNS resolution process for www.example.com.
**Solution:**
- Client queries local resolver → root server → TLD server → authoritative server → gets IP address

---

## Example 4: P2P Scalability
**Question:**
How does P2P architecture improve scalability?
**Solution:**
- More peers = more resources, distributes load

---

## Example 5: Socket Programming
**Question:**
Write a simple UDP client in Python.
**Solution:**
```python
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.sendto(b'Hello', ('example.com', 12345))
print(s.recvfrom(1024))
s.close()
```

## Example 6: Web Caching
**Question:**
What is the benefit of web caching? Where is a cache typically located?
**Solution:**
- Reduces response time and bandwidth usage. Typically located at ISP or within organizations.

---

## Example 7: Persistent vs. Non-Persistent HTTP
**Question:**
Describe the difference between persistent and non-persistent HTTP connections.
**Solution:**
- Persistent: Single TCP connection for multiple objects (faster, less overhead).
- Non-persistent: New TCP connection for each object (slower, more overhead).

## Example 8: Transport Service Requirements

**Question:**
For each application, specify the transport service requirements:
1. File transfer
2. Real-time video conferencing
3. Web browsing
4. Email

**Solution:**
1. **File transfer:** No data loss, elastic throughput, not time sensitive
2. **Real-time video conferencing:** Loss-tolerant, minimum throughput, very time sensitive (10s msec)
3. **Web browsing:** No data loss, elastic throughput, not time sensitive
4. **Email:** No data loss, elastic throughput, not time sensitive

## Example 9: DNS Resolution Process

**Question:**
Trace the DNS resolution process for www.example.com, starting from a local DNS server.

**Solution:**
1. Local DNS server checks cache
2. If not found, queries root server
3. Root server refers to .com TLD server
4. TLD server refers to example.com authoritative server
5. Authoritative server returns IP address
6. Local DNS server caches result and returns to client

## Example 10: BitTorrent Chunk Selection

**Question:**
Explain why BitTorrent uses "rarest first" chunk selection strategy.

**Solution:**
- Ensures all chunks remain available in the network
- Prevents "missing piece syndrome" where rare chunks become unavailable
- Improves overall download speed for all peers
- Maintains system robustness and efficiency

---

## Example 11: CDN Performance Analysis

**Question:**
Compare the performance of serving video from a single server vs. using a CDN with 40% cache hit rate.

**Solution:**
- **Single server:** All requests go to origin, high latency, potential congestion
- **CDN with 40% hit rate:** 40% served from cache (low latency), 60% from origin
- **Overall performance:** Significantly improved average response time
- **Bandwidth savings:** Reduced load on origin server and access links

---

## Example 12: Socket Programming Comparison

**Question:**
Compare UDP and TCP socket programming for a simple chat application.

**Solution:**
- **UDP:** No connection setup, messages may be lost/out of order, faster
- **TCP:** Connection setup required, reliable delivery, ordered messages
- **Chat choice:** TCP for reliable messaging, UDP for real-time features
- **Implementation:** TCP simpler for basic chat, UDP requires more error handling

---

## Example 13: HTTP Cookies and Privacy

**Question:**
Explain how third-party cookies can track user browsing behavior across multiple websites.

**Solution:**
- Third-party cookies set by advertisers (e.g., AdX) on multiple sites
- Same cookie value allows tracking across different domains
- Creates browsing profile for targeted advertising
- Privacy regulations (GDPR) now require explicit consent

---

## Example 14: DASH Adaptive Streaming

**Question:**
How does DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) work?

**Solution:**
- Server divides video into chunks encoded at different rates
- Client measures bandwidth and requests appropriate chunks
- Client can switch quality levels during playback
- Uses standard HTTP, works through firewalls and proxies

---

## Example 15: P2P vs Client-Server File Distribution

**Question:**
Calculate the time to distribute a 1GB file to 1000 peers using client-server vs P2P architecture.

**Solution:**
- **Client-Server:** Time = max(NF/us, F/dmin) = max(1000×1GB/10Mbps, 1GB/1Mbps)
- **P2P:** Time = max(F/us, F/dmin, NF/(us + Σui)) = max(1GB/10Mbps, 1GB/1Mbps, 1000×1GB/(10Mbps + 1000×1Mbps))
- **Result:** P2P significantly faster due to aggregated upload capacity
