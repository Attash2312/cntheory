## Creating a Network App

### Key Principles
- **Write programs that:**
  - Run on (different) end systems
  - Communicate over network
  - Example: web server software communicates with browser software
- **No need to write software for network-core devices**
- **Network-core devices do not run user applications**
- **Applications on end systems allows for rapid app development, propagation**

### Example: Web Application
- **Web server software** runs on server end system
- **Browser software** runs on client end system
- **HTTP protocol** enables communication between them
- **No application software** needed on routers, switches, or other network devices

---

## Application Architectures
- **Client-server:** Centralized server provides resources/services to clients (e.g., web browsing, email).
- **Peer-to-peer (P2P):** Peers act as both clients and servers (e.g., BitTorrent, blockchain).
- **Hybrid:** Combines both (e.g., Skype, WhatsApp).

---

## Real-World Example
- Web browser (client) requests a web page from a server using HTTP.
- File sharing apps (P2P) like BitTorrent distribute files among users.
- Messaging apps (hybrid) use central servers for login, P2P for file transfer.

```

---

## 2.1.1 Network Application Architectures
- **Client-Server:** Centralized server, multiple clients (e.g., web, email).
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** Peers act as both client and server (e.g., BitTorrent).
- **Hybrid:** Mix of client-server and P2P (e.g., Skype, modern streaming).
- **Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Client] -- Request --> B[Server]
  B -- Response --> A
  C[Peer 1] -- Data <--> D[Peer 2]
```

---

## 2.1.2 Processes Communicating

### Process Definition
- **Process:** Program running within a host
- **Inter-process communication:** Within same host, two processes communicate using inter-process communication (defined by OS)
- **Network communication:** Processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages

### Client and Server Processes
- **Note:** Applications with P2P architectures have client processes & server processes
- **Client process:** Process that initiates communication
- **Server process:** Process that waits to be contacted

### Example: Web Application
- **Client process:** Web browser (initiates HTTP request)
- **Server process:** Web server (waits for HTTP requests)
- **Communication:** HTTP messages exchanged between processes

## 2.1.3 Transport Services Available to Applications

### What Transport Service Does an App Need?

#### Data Integrity
- **Some apps (e.g., file transfer, web transactions)** require 100% reliable data transfer
- **Other apps (e.g., audio)** can tolerate some loss

#### Timing
- **Some apps (e.g., Internet telephony, interactive games)** require low delay to be "effective"
- **Other apps** can tolerate higher delays

#### Throughput
- **Some apps (e.g., multimedia)** require minimum amount of throughput to be "effective"
- **Other apps ("elastic apps")** make use of whatever throughput they get

#### Security
- **Encryption, data integrity, authentication**

### Transport Service Requirements: Common Apps

| Application | Data Loss | Throughput | Time Sensitive |
|-------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| File transfer/download | No loss | Elastic | No |
| E-mail | No loss | Elastic | No |
| Web documents | No loss | Elastic | No |
| Real-time audio/video | Loss-tolerant | Audio: 5Kbps-1Mbps<br/>Video: 10Kbps-5Mbps | Yes, 10's msec |
| Streaming audio/video | Loss-tolerant | Same as above | Yes, few secs |
