# 5.5 SDN Control Plane

- SDN (Software-Defined Networking) separates control and data planes.
- **Control plane:** Centralized logic, manages routing and forwarding.
- **Data plane:** Forwards packets based on rules.

---

## Internet Network Layer: Historical Implementation

### Traditional Approach
- **Historically implemented via distributed, per-router control approach:**
- **Monolithic router contains switching hardware, runs proprietary implementation of Internet standard protocols (IP, RIP, IS-IS, OSPF, BGP) in proprietary router OS (e.g., Cisco IOS)**
- **Different "middleboxes" for different network layer functions: firewalls, load balancers, NAT boxes, ..**

### Renewed Interest
- **~2005: renewed interest in rethinking network control plane**

---

## Software Defined Networking (SDN)

### Per-Router Control Plane
- **Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane to compute forwarding tables**
- **Routing Algorithm**
- **Data plane**
- **Control plane**

### SDN Control Plane
- **Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers**
- **Data plane**
- **Control plane**
- **Remote Controller**

---

## Why a Logically Centralized Control Plane?

### Advantages
- **Easier network management: avoid router misconfigurations, greater flexibility of traffic flows**
- **Table-based forwarding (recall OpenFlow API) allows "programming" routers**
- **Centralized "programming" easier: compute tables centrally and distribute**
- **Distributed "programming" more difficult: compute tables as result of distributed algorithm (protocol) implemented in each-and-every router**
- **Open (non-proprietary) implementation of control plane**
- **Foster innovation: let 1000 flowers bloom**

## SDN Analogy: Mainframe to PC Revolution

- **Closed, proprietary**
- **Slow innovation**

- **Specialized Operating System**
- **Specialized Hardware**
- **Specialized Applications**

### Horizontal (New)

## Traffic Engineering: Difficult with Traditional Routing

### Problem 1: Specific Path Routing
- **Q: what if network operator wants u-to-z traffic to flow along uvwz, rather than uxyz?**
- **A: need to re-define link weights so traffic routing algorithm computes routes accordingly (or need a new routing algorithm)!**
- **Link weights are only control "knobs": not much control!**

### Problem 2: Load Balancing
- **Q: what if network operator wants to split u-to-z traffic along uvwz and uxyz (load balancing)?**
- **A: can't do it (or need a new routing algorithm)**

### Problem 3: Different Traffic Types
- **Q: what if w wants to route blue and red traffic differently from w to z?**
- **A: can't do it (with destination-based forwarding, and LS, DV routing)**

### Solution
- **We learned in Chapter 4 that generalized forwarding and SDN can be used to achieve any routing desired**

## OpenFlow Protocol

  - **Controller-to-switch**
  - **Asynchronous (switch to controller)**
  - **Symmetric (misc.)**
- **Distinct from OpenFlow API**
- **API used to specify generalized forwarding actions**

---

## OpenFlow: Controller-to-Switch Messages

### Key Controller-to-Switch Messages
- **Features: controller queries switch features, switch replies**
- **Configure: controller queries/sets switch configuration parameters**
- **Modify-state: add, delete, modify flow entries in the OpenFlow tables**
- **Packet-out: controller can send this packet out of specific switch port**

---

## OpenFlow: Switch-to-Controller Messages

### Key Switch-to-Controller Messages
- **Packet-in: transfer packet (and its control) to controller. See packet-out message from controller**
- **Flow-removed: flow table entry deleted at switch**
- **Port status: inform controller of a change on a port**

### Note
- **Fortunately, network operators don't "program" switches by creating/sending OpenFlow messages directly. Instead use higher-level abstraction at controller**

---

## SDN: Control/Data Plane Interaction Example

### Step 1: Link Failure Detection
- **S1, experiencing link failure uses OpenFlow port status message to notify controller**

### Step 2: Controller Update
- **SDN controller receives OpenFlow message, updates link status info**

### Step 3: Algorithm Trigger
- **Dijkstra's routing algorithm application has previously registered to be called when ever link status changes. It is called.**

### Step 4: Route Computation
- **Dijkstra's routing algorithm access network graph info, link state info in controller, computes new routes**

### Step 5: Flow Table Computation
- **Link state routing app interacts with flow-table-computation component in SDN controller, which computes new flow tables needed**

### Step 6: Table Installation
- **Controller uses OpenFlow to install new tables in switches that need updating**

## SDN Controllers and OpenFlow
- **SDN Controller:** Centralized software that manages network devices, computes routes, and installs forwarding rules.
- **OpenFlow Protocol:** Standard protocol for communication between controller and switches. Allows controller to add, update, or delete flow entries in switch tables.
- **Controller-Switch Interaction:** Controller monitors network state, reacts to events, and updates switch rules dynamically.
