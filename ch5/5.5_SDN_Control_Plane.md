# 5.5 SDN Control Plane

- SDN (Software-Defined Networking) separates control and data planes.
- **Control plane:** Centralized logic, manages routing and forwarding.
- **Data plane:** Forwards packets based on rules.

---

## Centralized Routing
- Controller computes routes for the entire network.
- Pushes forwarding rules to switches.

## Summary Table
| Plane      | Function         | Example      |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Control    | Routing, mgmt    | Controller  |
| Data       | Forwarding       | Switch      |
