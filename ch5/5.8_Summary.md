# 5.8 Summary

- The network layer uses routing algorithms and protocols (OSPF, BGP, ICMP, SNMP) for path selection and management.
- Concepts: link-state, distance-vector, hierarchical routing, SDN, network management.

## Quick Revision Table
| Concept      | Key Point / Example         |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Routing      | Path selection, OSPF, BGP  |
| OSPF         | Link-state, intra-AS       |
| BGP          | Path vector, inter-AS      |
| SDN          | Control/data plane split   |
| ICMP         | Error reporting, ping      |
| SNMP         | Network management         |

**Exam Tips:**
- Focus on protocol features and routing algorithms.
- Practice drawing diagrams and explaining protocol operation.

## Additional Key Points
- **Distance Vector vs. Link State:** Comparison, count-to-infinity, protocol examples.
- **RIP:** Distance vector, hop count, limitations.
- **Hierarchical Routing:** AS, area border routers, scalability.
- **BGP Path Attributes:** AS-PATH, NEXT-HOP, LOCAL_PREF, MED, policy.
- **SDN Controllers:** OpenFlow, controller-switch interaction.
- **ICMP Traceroute/Ping:** Path discovery, round-trip time, diagrams.
