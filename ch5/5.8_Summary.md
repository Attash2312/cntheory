# 5.8 Summary

- The network layer uses routing algorithms and protocols (OSPF, BGP, ICMP, SNMP) for path selection and management.
- Concepts: link-state, distance-vector, hierarchical routing, SDN, network management.

## Quick Revision Table
| Concept      | Key Point / Example         |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Routing      | Path selection, OSPF, BGP  |
| OSPF         | Link-state, intra-AS       |
| BGP          | Path vector, inter-AS      |
| SDN          | Control/data plane split   |
| ICMP         | Error reporting, ping      |
| SNMP         | Network management         |
