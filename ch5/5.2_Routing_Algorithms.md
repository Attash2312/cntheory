# 5.2 Routing Algorithms

- Routing algorithms determine the best path for packets.
- **Types:** Link-state (Dijkstra), distance-vector (Bellman-Ford), hierarchical.

---

## Link-State Routing (Dijkstra)
- Each router knows the full network topology.
- Computes shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

---

## Distance-Vector Routing (Bellman-Ford)
- Routers know only their neighbors.
- Exchange distance vectors to compute shortest paths.

---

## Hierarchical Routing
- Divides network into regions for scalability.
