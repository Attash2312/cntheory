## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm Step-by-Step
**Question:**
Consider the following network topology:
```
u --2-- v --3-- w
|       |       |
1       2       5
|       |       |
x --1-- y --2-- z
```

Starting from node u, compute the shortest paths to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. Show each step.

**Solution:**
**Step 0:** N' = {u}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=∞, D(x)=1, D(y)=∞, D(z)=∞
**Step 1:** N' = {u,x}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=∞, D(x)=1, D(y)=2, D(z)=∞
**Step 2:** N' = {u,x,v}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=5, D(x)=1, D(y)=2, D(z)=∞
**Step 3:** N' = {u,x,v,y}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=3, D(x)=1, D(y)=2, D(z)=4
**Step 4:** N' = {u,x,v,y,w}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=3, D(x)=1, D(y)=2, D(z)=4
**Step 5:** N' = {u,x,v,y,w,z}, D(u)=0, D(v)=2, D(w)=3, D(x)=1, D(y)=2, D(z)=4

### Problem 2: Distance Vector Convergence
**Question:**
Explain why "bad news travels slow" in distance vector routing. Provide an example.

**Solution:**
When a link fails, routers may continue to believe they have a path through a neighbor that no longer exists. For example:
- Router A has direct path to destination X with cost 1
- Router B learns about X through A with cost 2
- If A's link to X fails, A updates its cost to ∞
- But B still thinks it can reach X through A with cost 2
- B advertises this to A, so A thinks it can reach X through B with cost 3
- This creates a count-to-infinity problem

### Problem 3: OSPF vs BGP Comparison
**Question:**
Compare and contrast OSPF and BGP in terms of:
a) Scope of operation
b) Routing algorithm type
c) Policy considerations
d) Scalability approach

**Solution:**
a) **Scope:** OSPF operates within an AS (intra-domain), BGP operates between ASes (inter-domain)
b) **Algorithm:** OSPF uses link-state (Dijkstra), BGP uses path-vector
c) **Policy:** OSPF focuses on performance, BGP heavily influenced by business policies
d) **Scalability:** OSPF uses areas, BGP uses AS hierarchy and route aggregation

### Problem 4: SDN Control Plane
**Question:**
Describe the interaction between an SDN controller and switches when a link fails. Include the sequence of messages exchanged.

**Solution:**
1. **Link failure detection:** Switch detects link failure
2. **Port status message:** Switch sends OpenFlow port status message to controller
3. **Controller update:** Controller updates its network topology database
4. **Algorithm trigger:** Routing algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra) is called
5. **Route computation:** New routes are computed
6. **Flow table computation:** New flow tables are generated
7. **Table installation:** Controller sends flow table updates to affected switches via OpenFlow

### Problem 5: ICMP Message Types
**Question:**
For each of the following scenarios, identify the appropriate ICMP message type and code:
a) A router cannot forward a packet because the destination network is unreachable
b) A host sends a ping to test connectivity
c) A packet's TTL expires at a router
d) A UDP packet arrives at a port with no listening application

**Solution:**
a) Type 3, Code 0 (Destination network unreachable)
b) Type 8, Code 0 (Echo request) and Type 0, Code 0 (Echo reply)
c) Type 11, Code 0 (TTL expired)
d) Type 3, Code 3 (Destination port unreachable)

### Problem 6: BGP Route Selection
**Question:**
A BGP router receives three routes to destination 192.168.1.0/24:
- Route A: AS-PATH [AS3, AS2], LOCAL_PREF 100, MED 50
- Route B: AS-PATH [AS4], LOCAL_PREF 200, MED 30
- Route C: AS-PATH [AS5, AS2], LOCAL_PREF 100, MED 20

Which route will be selected and why?

**Solution:**
Route B will be selected because:
1. **LOCAL_PREF:** Route B has highest LOCAL_PREF (200) - this is the first criterion
2. If LOCAL_PREF were equal, then AS-PATH length would be considered
3. If AS-PATH were equal, then MED would be considered

### Problem 7: SNMP vs NETCONF
**Question:**
Compare SNMP and NETCONF in terms of:
a) Data representation
b) Transport protocol
c) Configuration capabilities
d) Security features

**Solution:**
a) **Data representation:** SNMP uses ASN.1, NETCONF uses XML
b) **Transport:** SNMP uses UDP, NETCONF uses TCP with TLS
c) **Configuration:** SNMP limited configuration, NETCONF full configuration management
d) **Security:** SNMP has basic authentication, NETCONF has strong encryption and authentication

### Problem 8: Network Management Architecture
**Question:**
Draw and explain the components of a network management system, including:
- Managed devices
- Management server
- Network management protocol
- Data flow between components

**Solution:**
```
[Management Server] ←→ [Network Management Protocol] ←→ [Managed Device]
                              ↑
                        [Agent Software]
                              ↑
                        [MIB Database]
```

**Question:**
Explain how traceroute works, including:
a) The packet types used
b) How TTL is manipulated
c) How the path is discovered
d) What happens when the destination is reached

**Solution:**
a) **Packet types:** UDP segments (most implementations) or ICMP echo requests
b) **TTL manipulation:** Starts with TTL=1, increments for each hop
c) **Path discovery:** Each router decrements TTL, when TTL=0, sends ICMP "Time Exceeded"
d) **Destination reached:** Destination sends ICMP "Port Unreachable" (UDP) or "Echo Reply" (ICMP)

### Problem 10: SDN vs Traditional Routing
**Question:**
Compare traditional routing protocols with SDN in terms of:
a) Control plane architecture
b) Route computation
c) Flexibility for traffic engineering
d) Scalability considerations
