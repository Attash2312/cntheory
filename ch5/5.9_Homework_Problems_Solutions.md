# 5.9 Homework Problems and Solutions

## Example 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm
**Question:**
Explain how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path.
**Solution:**
- Computes shortest path from source to all nodes using link costs and updating tentative distances.

## Example 2: BGP Path Vector
**Question:**
How does BGP prevent routing loops?
**Solution:**
- Uses AS path information; if a router sees its own AS in the path, it rejects the route.

---

## Example 3: OSPF Areas
**Question:**
Why does OSPF use areas?
**Solution:**
- Improves scalability by limiting LSA flooding and reducing routing table size.

---

## Example 4: ICMP Use Case
**Question:**
What is the purpose of ICMP echo request/reply?
**Solution:**
- Used by ping to test connectivity and measure round-trip time.

---

## Example 5: SNMP Scenario
**Question:**
How does SNMP help in network management?
**Solution:**
- Allows centralized monitoring, configuration, and fault detection of network devices.

---

## Example 6: Bellman-Ford Example
**Question:**
Given a simple network, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute the shortest path from node A to all other nodes. (Provide a small network diagram and step-by-step solution.)
**Solution:**
- [Provide a diagram and walk through the Bellman-Ford steps for each node.]

## Example 7: Policy-Based Routing
**Question:**
What is policy-based routing in BGP and why is it important?
**Solution:**
- Allows ISPs to select routes based on business or performance policies, not just shortest path.
